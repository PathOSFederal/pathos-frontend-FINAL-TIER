/**
 * ============================================================================
 * SHARED ROUTE CONSTANTS — Single source of truth for Sidebar and routing
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * PURPOSE: All Sidebar hrefs and canonical route paths live here so Next (3000)
 * and Desktop (5173) stay in parity. No string duplication in shell/nav.
 *
 * RULES:
 * - Sidebar links MUST use these constants.
 * - Both Next and Desktop MUST resolve every href (real screen or placeholder).
 * - Guided Apply: canonical path is GUIDED_APPLY_CANON; GUIDED_APPLY_ALIAS
 *   is for redirects only (not used by Sidebar).
