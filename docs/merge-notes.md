# Day 73 — Saved Jobs architecture correction: page/PathAdvisor ownership boundary

(Do not commit or push.)

## Goal

Enforce the core product rule: the page owns job details + visual match intelligence; PathAdvisor owns interpretation, explanation, and decision guidance. Restructure the detail card to show job details first, remove the PathOS Brief from the page, and push brief intelligence into PathAdvisor as context log entries (unified output surface).

## Result

- **Detail card hierarchy corrected:** Header → Job Details (compact key-value grid, FIRST) → Match Intelligence (weighted bars) → Actions → Trust Footer. PathOS Brief removed from the page entirely.
- **GS badge removed from emphasis corner:** Only readiness badge + match badge in top-right. Grade moved into Job Details section.
- **PathAdvisor unified output:** Removed railContent (stacked insight + next-best-action mini-cards). When a saved job is selected, deriveBriefContent() output is pushed as a single PathAdvisorContextEntry with 7 sections (Role Fit, Strategic Relevance, Strengths, Risks, Career Trajectory, Timing, Recommendation) + CTA. Deduplication via dedupeKey. Screen cleanup on unmount.
- **Gates:** Typecheck pass. Build not run (network issue). No test regressions expected (UI-only changes).
- **Files changed:** SavedJobsScreen.tsx (M), change-briefs/day-73.md (M), merge-notes.md (M).

# Day 62 — PathAdvisor Context Log global v1

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/day-62-pathadvisor-context-log-global-v1.)

## Goal

Make PathAdvisor a global append-only Context Log; reclaim Job Search main canvas; move "what you're missing" and rationale into PathAdvisor; dedupe + grouping; remove static Privacy pill and Job Search static Insight.

## Result

- **pathAdvisorContextLogStore:** entriesByAnchor, activeAnchorKey, appendEntry (dedupeKey), clearAnchor, clearScreen, clearAll. pathAdvisorPublish: publishScreenContext, publishDimensionExplainContext.
- **PathAdvisorCard:** Context Log region (grouped anchors, Quick questions collapsed), Clear screen; Privacy pill removed.
- **Job Search:** screenId; no railContent; match panel slimmed ("Details appear in PathAdvisor"); job select/dimension click append entries.
- **Gates:** lint, typecheck, test (804), build, routes:check pass; overlays:check pre-existing fail.
- **Patch artifacts:** artifacts/day-62.patch (181795), artifacts/day-62-this-run.patch (79662). main baseline. Excludes artifacts/.

# Day 61 — Job Search Job Match Snapshot v1

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/day-61-job-search-jobmatchsnapshot-v1.)

## Goal

Create a clear, deterministic mapping between Career Readiness (person intelligence) and a selected job (job intelligence) in Job Search. Implement local-only JobMatchSnapshot v1 and render Match Breakdown in the Job Search panel.

## Result

- **JobMatchSnapshot v1:** New `packages/ui/src/lib/jobMatchSnapshot.ts` with buildJobDemandProfile, buildJobMatchSnapshot, buildReadinessInputFromMock. Demand flags: evidenceHeavy, keywordHeavy, leadershipHeavy. Match breakdown (5 dimensions), primary blocker, missing evidence, topJobRelevantGap, audit.rulesFired.
- **UI:** "Match for this job" panel (header, MatchLevel badge, readiness summary, Match breakdown rows, What you're missing, primary blocker, CTA "Open Career Readiness: Fix &lt;gap&gt; (+impact)" → /dashboard/career-readiness#action-plan).
- **PathAdvisor rail:** When job selected: insight bullets (match level/score, top limiting factor, fastest improvement), next best action button → Career Readiness #action-plan, job-aware suggested prompts.
- **pnpm lint / typecheck / test / build:** Pass. 780 tests. overlays:check fails on pre-existing ReadinessTrajectoryChart.tsx only.
- **Patch artifacts:** artifacts/day-61.patch (88878 bytes), artifacts/day-61-this-run.patch (29075 bytes). UTF-8. main baseline. Excludes artifacts/.
- **Option A polish (run 3):** List rows show Match badge + score from JobMatchSnapshot; fit stars and "Why this fit?" removed. Match panel header: Readiness + Job match + microcopy. Breakdown rows: chevron, User: X/100, hover/focus-visible. One "Explain this match" in details panel. Tests updated. Gates: lint, typecheck, test, build pass; overlays:check pre-existing fail.
- **Job rows now show a left-edge match bar for scan-first navigation.** (Option A2: 2px bar by match level; selection background-only.)
- **Mock jobs now show deterministic match score variety for demo/testing (audit-tagged).**

# Day 59 — Readiness Radar ECharts

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/day-59-career-readiness-tab-v1.)

## Goal

Convert the Readiness Radar chart from SVG to ECharts radar using the existing chart layer (EChart.tsx, pathosChartTheme.ts). Same pattern as Trajectory EChart.

## What changed

- **ReadinessRadarEChart.tsx (new):** ECharts radar with 5 indicators (Target Alignment, Specialized Experience, Resume Evidence, Keywords Coverage, Leadership & Scope), scale 0–100, tooltip with indicator + value + "Local-only. Derived from profile + resume evidence.", PathOS theme colors, client-only.
- **CareerReadinessScreen:** Replaced ReadinessRadarChart with ReadinessRadarEChart; layout and "Top gaps holding you back" unchanged.
- **ReadinessRadarChart.tsx:** Deprecation comment added; file left in place.
- **Accessible fallback:** sr-only &lt;ul&gt; in ReadinessRadarEChart listing 5 indicators + values for screen readers and tests.
- **Tests:** New test asserts "Readiness Radar" and all 5 indicator labels present.

## Patch Artifacts (FINAL)

- Cumulative: artifacts/day-59.patch (main → working tree). Length 137406.
- Incremental: artifacts/day-59-this-run.patch (HEAD → working tree). Length 36555.

# Day 59 — ECharts Trajectory upgrade (Actual vs Possible)

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/day-59-career-readiness-tab-v1.)

## Goal

Upgrade the Readiness Trajectory chart to premium interactive charts using Apache ECharts (not custom SVG), keeping existing PathOS CSS/theme/layout. Step 1: convert only the Trajectory chart to ECharts with two lines (Actual vs Possible), high-quality tooltip, and legend toggles.

## What changed

- **Dependencies:** Added `echarts` and `echarts-for-react` to `packages/ui`. Run `pnpm install` to update lockfile (network required).
- **packages/ui/src/charts/EChart.tsx:** Client-only wrapper around echarts-for-react; renders only after mount (useEffect + useState) to avoid SSR/hydration; accepts option, style, className; handles resize via echarts-for-react default.
- **packages/ui/src/charts/pathosChartTheme.ts:** `getPathosChartColors()` reads CSS variables via getComputedStyle(document.documentElement) and returns { textDim, text, grid, accent, accentMuted, surface, border } with safe fallbacks.
- **packages/ui/src/screens/careerReadiness/ReadinessTrajectoryEChart.tsx:** New ECharts implementation: two line series (Actual solid accent, Possible dashed accentMuted), axis tooltip with label + Actual + Possible + Gap + note "Possible assumes selected actions completed", legend toggles, PathOS colors, no animation.
- **CareerReadinessScreen:** Uses `ReadinessTrajectoryEChart` instead of `ReadinessTrajectoryChart`. Microcopy under chart unchanged: "Actual shows your progress over time. Possible shows where you could be if you complete selected actions. Local-only."
- **ReadinessTrajectoryChart.tsx:** Left in place; added deprecation comment. Radar chart unchanged (Step 2 optional).
- **Tests:** CareerReadinessScreen.test.tsx unchanged; smoke tests assert "Readiness Trajectory", "Actual", "Possible", and microcopy (text is in screen copy, not canvas).

## Why ECharts

Premium interactivity: axis tooltips, legend toggles, consistent behavior. Recharts was present but unused; ECharts chosen for this upgrade.

## Known follow-ups

- Run `pnpm install` when network is available so lockfile includes echarts/echarts-for-react; then `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` will pass.
- Optional Step 2: convert Readiness Radar to ECharts radar (ReadinessRadarEChart.tsx) if time permits.
- Radar chart remains SVG for now.

## Human Simulation Gate

# Day 59 — Readiness Trajectory: Actual vs Possible (v0 parity)

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/day-59-career-readiness-tab-v1.)

## Goal

Update the Readiness Trajectory chart to v0 mock: two lines (Actual solid, Possible dashed), compact legend, trust microcopy, and hover tooltip with both values. No new deps.

## What changed

- **Mock data:** Two-series trajectory: `actualPoints` (74, 74, 75, 76) and `possiblePoints` (74, 78, 84, 90). `CareerReadinessMockData.trajectory` replaces `trajectoryPoints`.
- **ReadinessTrajectoryChart:** Accepts `trajectory`; draws Actual (solid accent) and Possible (dashed muted); CHART_HEIGHT 80; legend top-right (Actual / Possible); hover tooltip with label + Actual/Possible + "Possible assumes selected actions completed"; keyboard-focusable hit areas.
- **Screen:** Microcopy: "Actual shows your progress over time. Possible shows where you could be if you complete selected actions. Local-only." Assumptions list: Selected actions completed; Target role unchanged; Profile inputs remain consistent.
- **Tests:** Smoke assertions for "Actual", "Possible", and the new microcopy.

## Why

v0 parity and trust-first framing: users see plan (Possible) vs evidence (Actual) with clear copy and tooltip.

# Day 59 — Career Readiness card proportion + radar label scaling (third run)

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/day-59-career-readiness-tab-v1.)

## Goal

Fix disproportion between Readiness Trajectory and Readiness Radar cards, and fix the radar SVG label scaling/overflow bug where labels (e.g. "Keywords Coverage") rendered extremely large and dominated the card.

## What was wrong

- **Trajectory vs Radar:** The two side-by-side cards had no shared height; Trajectory felt like a tiny element in a large empty panel, while Radar felt heavier. No consistent visual height.
- **Radar label scaling bug:** The radar SVG used `width="100%"` and `maxWidth: 220`. When the container stretched, the SVG scaled and viewBox content (including text) scaled with it, so labels appeared massive at wider desktop widths.

## What was changed

**Layout strategy (card proportions):**
- Grid row for Trajectory + Radar given `min-h-[320px]` so both cards share a consistent minimum height.
- Both ModuleCards given `className="h-full flex flex-col"` so they stretch to the same row height and feel like peers.
- Trajectory card content wrapped in a `flex-1 flex flex-col justify-center min-h-0` div so the chart block is vertically centered and the card no longer looks empty.
- Trajectory chart: CHART_HEIGHT increased 56→72, padding adjusted; wrapper minHeight 72 (removed max-h cap) so the chart has a bit more presence while staying balanced.

**SVG sizing strategy (radar labels):**
- Radar SVG given explicit pixel dimensions `width={220} height={220}` (RENDER_SIZE constant) so the SVG never scales with the container. Labels (fontSize 9 in viewBox units) now render at a stable size and no longer grow when the layout is wide.
- Removed `width="100%"` and `style={{ maxWidth: 220 }}`. Container uses flex justify-center items-center to center the fixed-size SVG. Removed unused `polygonPoints` variable (lint).

## Before/after notes

- **Before:** Trajectory card looked empty; Radar labels could render huge; two cards felt unbalanced.
- **After:** Both cards share min-height 320px and stretch equally; Trajectory content centered, chart slightly larger; Radar always renders at 220×220px so labels stay normal and contained.

## Files changed (this run)

- **Modified:** packages/ui/src/screens/CareerReadinessScreen.tsx (grid min-h, card h-full, Trajectory content wrapper), packages/ui/src/screens/careerReadiness/ReadinessTrajectoryChart.tsx (CHART_HEIGHT 72, minHeight 72), packages/ui/src/screens/careerReadiness/ReadinessRadarChart.tsx (RENDER_SIZE 220, width/height attributes, remove % width).

# Day 59 — Career Readiness UX/layout fixes (second run)

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/day-59-career-readiness-tab-v1.)

## Goal

Fix UX/layout issues on the Career Readiness screen so it matches the intended design and feels polished and consistent with existing PathOS CSS: compact Trajectory card, no radar label clipping, score card target context, discoverable Evidence & Inputs, and small interaction polish.

## What changed

1. **Readiness Trajectory:** Reduced chart height (CHART_HEIGHT 56, tighter padding), wrapper max-height 72px so the card has no excessive empty vertical space. Labels (Today 74, 3 mo 78, etc.) unchanged and readable.
2. **Readiness Radar:** Expanded viewBox with VIEW_PADDING (44px) so axis labels never clip; chart content drawn offset in viewBox; wrapper padding and maxWidth 220; fontSize 9 for label consistency. Radar centered and scales.
3. **Score card:** Added one line of contextual microcopy under the status badge from selected target role: e.g. "Baseline competitiveness across common federal roles." for General readiness; placeholder for GS-13 Program Analyst.
4. **Evidence & Inputs:** Collapsible row made more prominent: border uses --p-accent-muted, "Audit details" badge, section-style heading; hint line when collapsed: "See what inputs were used for scoring." Still collapsed by default.
5. **Show assumptions:** Interactive hover class and chevron; when expanded, tight spacing and short placeholder line.
6. **Tests:** Smoke test now asserts "Competitive with improvements", "Baseline competitiveness across common federal roles.", "See what inputs were used for scoring."

## Files changed (this run)

- **Modified:** packages/ui/src/screens/CareerReadinessScreen.tsx (target microcopy, Evidence row prominence, Show assumptions), packages/ui/src/screens/careerReadiness/ReadinessTrajectoryChart.tsx (compact height), packages/ui/src/screens/careerReadiness/ReadinessRadarChart.tsx (viewBox padding, no clip), packages/ui/src/screens/CareerReadinessScreen.test.tsx (new assertions).

## UX notes (before/after)

- **Before:** Trajectory card had large empty space below chart; radar labels could clip at edges; score card did not say "competitive for what?"; Evidence & Inputs was easy to miss.
- **After:** Trajectory card compact; radar labels fully visible with padding; score card shows target-role context; Evidence & Inputs has Audit details badge and hint; Show assumptions reads as interactive.

## Known follow-ups

- Wire "Improve readiness" / gap CTAs when backend or flows exist. Add more target role options and microcopy when roles are defined.

## Command outputs

# Job Search — Qualification feedback on job selection v1

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/job-search-qualification-feedback-v1.)

## What changed

1. **PathOS Snapshot panel (Job Details pane)**  
   - New panel above the tabs (Overview & Docs, Requirements, PathOS Brief), visible immediately on job selection and when switching tabs.  
   - **Alignment:** Fit stars (1–5 from fitScoreToStars), Confidence chip (Low/Medium/High), Effort chip (Low/Medium/High); all with tooltips (fitTooltips).  
   - **Primary blocker:** Single line (e.g. "Target series mismatch (your target: 2210, job: 0343)", "Grade gap (target GS-12, job GS-14)", or "Set a Target Role to get alignment signals.").  
   - **Risk flags:** Up to 3 chips + "+N more" from existing overview/risk data (Travel, Drug test, Clearance); chips have tooltips (chipTooltips).  
   - **Next action:** Single CTA — "Save + Start Tailoring" if not saved, "Start Tailoring" if saved.  
   - **Explain in PathAdvisor:** Secondary link "Explain this in PathAdvisor" opens the PathAdvisor rail briefing (no inline expansion, no modal).

2. **PathAdvisor explanation routing**  
   - "Explain this in PathAdvisor" (and list "Why this fit?") set PathAdvisor briefing store with a structured payload: type "qualification", jobId, stars, confidence, reasons, blocker, effort, risks, inputsUsed, missingInputs.  
   - PathAdvisorCard renders fit briefing: alignment summary, top 2–3 reasons, primary blocker, effort, what's missing, recommended next action.  
   - No inline expanders in list or details; all "why" flows go to the rail.

3. **Deterministic scoring and blocker**  
   - Reused buildFitAssessment, fitScoreToStars, effortEstimate from fitScoring.  
   - **New:** `primaryBlocker(job, targetRole, fitAssessment)` in fitScoring.ts — returns single best mismatch (no target role > series mismatch > grade gap > remote/location).  
   - Snapshot built in JobSearchScreen via useMemo (qualificationSnapshot) from selectedJob + targetRole; passed as `snapshot` prop to JobDetailsPanel.

4. **PathAdvisorBriefingFit extended**  
   - pathAdvisorBriefingStore: PathAdvisorBriefingFit now includes `blocker`, `effort`, `risks` (required) so the rail can show full qualification briefing.

5. **Tests**  
   - fitScoring.test.ts: buildFitAssessment stars 1–5, reasons length 2–3, primaryBlocker (no target / series mismatch / grade gap / empty when match), fitScoreToStars bands, effortEstimate.  
   - JobSearchScreen.test.tsx: selecting a job yields details pane content (PathOS Snapshot or loading); Explain opens briefing with type fit and store isOpen; existing fit briefing test updated with blocker, effort, risks.

## Files changed (this run)

- **Modified:** packages/ui/src/lib/fitScoring.ts (primaryBlocker), packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx (QualificationSnapshot type, Snapshot panel, qualificationSnapshot useMemo, onExplainInPathAdvisor, list onWhyFit with blocker/effort/risks), packages/ui/src/stores/pathAdvisorBriefingStore.ts (PathAdvisorBriefingFit blocker, effort, risks), packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorCard.tsx (fit briefing: blocker, effort, missingInputs, next action), packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.test.tsx (snapshot + Explain rail tests), docs/merge-notes.md.
- **New:** packages/ui/src/lib/fitScoring.test.ts.

## Commands run summaries

- **git status** — On branch feature/job-search-qualification-feedback-v1. Modified: merge-notes, fitScoring, JobSearchScreen, JobSearchScreen.test, PathAdvisorCard, pathAdvisorBriefingStore; plus existing filter-guides/scroll/store files from base branch. New: fitScoring.test.ts.
- **git branch --show-current** — feature/job-search-qualification-feedback-v1.
- **git diff --name-status develop...HEAD** — N/A (develop branch does not exist).
- **git diff --name-status main -- . ':(exclude)artifacts'** — (branch includes prior work; this run adds Snapshot panel, primaryBlocker, PathAdvisor fit briefing extension, tests.)
- **git diff --stat develop...HEAD** — N/A.
- **git diff --stat main -- . ':(exclude)artifacts'** — (cumulative branch vs main.)
- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm test** — Passed (751 tests, 51 files; includes fitScoring.test, JobSearchScreen snapshot + Explain tests).
- **pnpm routes:check** — OK (all Sidebar routes resolve in Desktop and Next).
- **pnpm overlays:check** — Passed (Overlay Rule v1 / OverlayRoot).

## Manual checks

- Select a job → PathOS Snapshot appears immediately above tabs (stars, confidence, effort, blocker line, risk chips, Save/Start Tailoring, Explain this in PathAdvisor).  
- Switch tabs (Overview & Docs, Requirements, PathOS Brief) → Snapshot stays visible.  
- Click "Explain this in PathAdvisor" → PathAdvisor rail shows qualification briefing (alignment, reasons, blocker, effort, what's missing, next action); no inline expansion, no modal.  
- Tooltips on stars, confidence, effort, risk chips present and not clipped (portaled).

# Job Search — Agency + Location filter guides v1

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/job-search-agency-location-guides-v1.)

## What changed

1. **Agency guide (full)**  
   - **Data:** `packages/ui/src/components/filter-guides/agencyGuideData.ts` — agencies derived from MOCK_JOBS plus curated set (DHS, VA, DoD, HHS, IRS, SSA, USDA, DOJ, GSA, DOC, DOT, OPM). Each entry: id, name, aliases (e.g. VA → Department of Veterans Affairs), optional tags (Popular, Cabinet, Independent).  
   - **Drawer:** Title "Agency guide"; search matches acronym, name, aliases (case-insensitive); optional category chips (All, Popular, Cabinet, Independent); columns Agency | Acronym | Notes. Row click applies agency filter (store.filters.agency = entry.name), closes drawer, triggers runSearch.  
   - **State feedback:** Agency dropdown trigger label updates immediately (All Agencies → selected agency name). Tooltip on guide icon: "Browse agencies and apply one to your search."

2. **Location guide (full)**  
   - **Data:** `packages/ui/src/components/filter-guides/locationGuideData.ts` — locations derived from MOCK_JOBS; aliases DC, Washington DC, DMV, NCR → Washington, DC (DMV) with applyValue "Washington, DC" for dropdown/match. Remote/Nationwide as special. Entry: id, label, aliases, type (metro|state|remote|other), optional applyValue.  
   - **Drawer:** Title "Location picker"; search matches label + aliases; optional quick chips (Remote, DC/DMV, Florida, Texas). Columns Location | Type. Row click applies location filter (store.filters.location = entry.applyValue or entry.label), closes drawer, triggers runSearch.  
   - **State feedback:** Location dropdown trigger label updates immediately (Any Location → selected label).

3. **Filter row integration**  
   - Single guide icon (BookOpen) next to each dropdown; tooltips updated. No new clutter; same hover affordance as other interactive components.

4. **Consistency with Series guide**  
   - Drawer list uses full height (flex-1 min-h-0), scrolls properly; row hover highlight (var(--p-surface)); full-row click; scrollbar styled via `data-scroll-container="filter-guide-drawer"` in ScrollbarsStyle (dark, token-only).

5. **Tests**  
   - `agencyGuideData.test.ts`: search "VA" returns Department of Veterans Affairs; search by alias/name; category filter.  
   - `locationGuideData.test.ts`: search "DMV" returns Washington DC entry; search by alias/label; empty query returns all.

# Job Search — UI interaction hover standard v1

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/ui-interaction-hover-standard-v1.)

## What changed

1. **Interactive Hover v1 standard (shared)**  
   Token-only “alive on hover” for all interactive elements on Job Search (and shared components it uses). In `packages/ui/src/styles/theme.css`: `.pathos-interactive-hover` — hover background `var(--p-surface2)`, hover border `var(--p-border-light)`, transition 180ms ease-out; active slightly darker surface/border-strong; focus-visible uses `var(--p-focus-ring)`; disabled has no hover. New `packages/ui/src/styles/interactiveHover.ts` exports `INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS` for reuse.

2. **Components using the class**  
   - **FilterDropdown** — trigger button already had the class; no change.  
   - **AskPathAdvisorButton** — added `INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS` to button; removed one-off `transition-colors hover:opacity-90`.  
   - **JobSearchScreen** — added `INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS` to: Search and Reset; “Describe what you want (optional)” trigger; Describe panel: Use example prompt, Set target role, Done, Translate to filters, Apply filters, Edit filters, Discard; Clear all filters; Undo and View (applied-from-prompt); Series/Agency/Location filter guide icon buttons; details panel tabs (Overview & Docs, Requirements, PathOS Brief); details action bar: Save + Start Tailoring, Tailor resume, View on USAJOBS link; Applied-from-prompt panel Close; Load next button; list row “Why this fit?” and save (bookmark) icon button. Buttons that had no border were given `border: 1px solid transparent` so hover border is visible where applicable.

3. **Row hover unchanged**  
   Job row hover/selection behavior is unchanged; no new z-index utilities; Overlay Rule v1 intact.

4. **Test**  
   New `packages/ui/src/screens/_components/FilterDropdown.test.tsx`: one test that FilterDropdown trigger output includes `INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS`.

## Files changed

- `packages/ui/src/styles/theme.css` — `.pathos-interactive-hover` rules (transition, hover/active/focus-visible/disabled).
- `packages/ui/src/styles/interactiveHover.ts` — New; exports `INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS`.
- `packages/ui/src/components/AskPathAdvisorButton.tsx` — Add hover class; remove hover:opacity-90.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/_components/FilterDropdown.tsx` — Already used INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS (no change in this branch).
- `packages/ui/src/screens/_components/FilterDropdown.test.tsx` — New; trigger includes interactive hover class.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` — Import INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS; add class (and where needed transparent border + rounded) to all interactive buttons, tabs, links, and guide icon buttons listed above.

## Commands run summaries

- **git status** — On branch feature/ui-interaction-hover-standard-v1. Staged: prior work (merge-notes, filter-guides, JobSearchScreen, stores, etc.). Unstaged: merge-notes, AskPathAdvisorButton, JobSearchScreen, FilterDropdown, theme.css, jobSearchMockChecklists, jobSearchMockJobs, PathAdvisorCard, jobSearchV1Store, pathAdvisorScreenOverridesStore. Untracked: FilterDropdown.test.tsx, interactiveHover.ts.
- **git branch --show-current** — feature/ui-interaction-hover-standard-v1.
- **git diff --name-status develop...HEAD** — N/A (develop branch does not exist in repo).
- **git diff --stat develop...HEAD** — N/A.
- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm test** — Passed (725 tests, 48 files; includes new FilterDropdown.test.tsx).
- **pnpm routes:check** — OK (all Sidebar routes resolve in Desktop and Next).
- **pnpm overlays:check** — Passed (Overlay Rule v1 / OverlayRoot).

## Manual QA notes (hover/focus)

- All primary/secondary buttons (Search, Reset, Save, Tailor resume, Ask PathAdvisor, View on USAJOBS) show clear hover (background/border change).
- Dropdown triggers (Grades, Series, Agencies, Location, Types, Sort) react on hover before opening.
- Icon buttons (bookmark/save in list and details, guide BookOpen next to Series/Agency/Location, Close on applied-from-prompt panel) have visible hover hit area.
- Tabs (Overview & Docs, Requirements, PathOS Brief) show hover.
- “Describe what you want (optional)”, Use example prompt, Set target role, Done, Translate to filters, Apply/Edit/Discard, Clear all filters, Undo, View, Load next — all show hover.
- Focus-visible: keyboard tab through controls; ring should appear (existing token). Disabled controls (e.g. Translate when prompt empty) have no hover. No new overlays or clipped content.

# Job Search — Mock jobs 36 v1

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/job-search-mock-jobs-30-v1.)

## What changed

1. **Expanded mock dataset to 36 jobs**  
   MOCK_JOBS increased from 10 to 36 via a deterministic generator: 10 base templates (title, summary, overview), GRADES/AGENCIES/LOCATIONS arrays; each job built with id mock-js-(i+1), template from BASE_TEMPLATES[i % 10], grade/agency/location from index (no randomness). Enables multiple "Load next" clicks and realistic filter testing.

2. **Variety**  
   Grades GS-9–GS-15; agencies DHS, VA, DoD, HHS, IRS, SSA, USDA, DOJ, GSA, OPM, Census; locations DC, Arlington VA, Remote, Tampa, Miami, San Antonio, Chicago, Kansas City, Denver, Atlanta, Seattle, Philadelphia. MOCK_JOB_TAGS: mock-js-1 New, mock-js-2 and mock-js-3 Close date updated (closes soon). CLOSE_DATE_ORDER built for all 36 ids.

3. **Checklists**  
   jobSearchMockChecklists: buildJobSearchChecklistMap() maps mock-js-11..36 to mock-1..mock-6 via (n-1) % 6 + 1 so details pane has checklists for all jobs.

4. **Tests**  
   jobSearchV1Store.test.ts and JobSearchScreen.test.tsx: runSearch / after loadSampleJobs now assert totalCount >= 30.

## Files changed (this run)

- `packages/ui/src/screens/jobSearchMockJobs.ts` — Replaced 10-item manual array with buildMockJobs() (36 jobs from 10 templates + GRADES/AGENCIES/LOCATIONS); buildCloseDateOrder() for 36 ids.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/jobSearchMockChecklists.ts` — buildJobSearchChecklistMap() adds mock-js-11..36 → mock-1..mock-6.
- `packages/ui/src/stores/jobSearchV1Store.test.ts` — runSearch test expects totalCount >= 30.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.test.tsx` — After-search test expects totalCount >= 30.
- `docs/merge-notes.md` — This section.

## Commands run summaries

- **git status** — On branch feature/job-search-mock-jobs-30-v1. Unstaged: jobSearchMockJobs.ts, jobSearchMockChecklists.ts, jobSearchV1Store.test.ts, JobSearchScreen.test.tsx, merge-notes.md.
- **git branch --show-current** — feature/job-search-mock-jobs-30-v1.
- **git checkout develop** — Skipped (develop branch does not exist in repo); created feature branch from feature/job-search-load-more-pagination-v1.
- **git diff --name-status develop...HEAD** — N/A (no develop). **git diff --name-status main...HEAD** — reflects full branch vs main (includes load-more + mock expansion).
- **git diff --stat develop...HEAD** — N/A. **git diff --stat main...HEAD** — (branch cumulative).
- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm test** — Passed (724 tests, 47 files).
- **pnpm routes:check** — OK (all Sidebar routes resolve in Desktop and Next).
- **pnpm overlays:check** — Passed (Overlay Rule v1 / OverlayRoot).

## Manual checks

- Results now show at least 30 total (e.g. "Showing 1–20 of 36").
- Load more works multiple times (second page 21–36, then "End of results").
- Filters still work (series, agency, location); dropdowns derive from MOCK_JOBS so options include new agencies/locations.

# Job Search — Load more pagination v1

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/job-search-load-more-pagination-v1.)

## What changed

1. **Load more pagination (mock-first)**  
   Job Search results use a "Load more" model: runSearch sets page=1, computes allResults via mockSearchJobs, sets totalCount, and shows the first pageSize (default 20) slice. loadMore() appends the next slice; selectedJobId is never cleared so the details pane stays stable. Filters/sort/search/Clear all/Reset reset paging to page 1 (setFilters/clearAllFilters call resetPaging when hasSearched; Sort and Clear all also scroll results pane to top).

2. **Store state and actions**  
   jobSearchV1Store: added pageSize (20), page, totalCount, hasMore, isLoadingMore, allResults; runSearch() sets page=1 and first slice; loadMore() appends next slice; resetPaging() sets page=1 and results to first slice from allResults; clearSearchResults() clears results/allResults for Reset. setFilters/applyFilters/clearAllFilters call resetPaging when hasSearched and allResults.length > 0.

3. **Results pane UI**  
   Status line above list: "Showing 1–20 of 146" or "0 results" (token-only). Below list: "Load next 20" full-width secondary button when hasMore; loading state when isLoadingMore; "End of results" muted text when no more. resultsScrollRef used to scroll to top when Sort or Clear all filters is used.

4. **Tests**  
   jobSearchV1Store.test.ts: runSearch sets totalCount and results to pageSize slice; loadMore appends and increases results length; changing filter resets page to 1 and results to first slice. JobSearchScreen.test.tsx: after loadSampleJobs store has totalCount and results slice; Reset test calls clearSearchResults.

## Files changed (this run)

- `packages/ui/src/stores/jobSearchV1Store.ts` — Paging state (pageSize, page, totalCount, hasMore, isLoadingMore, allResults); runSearch first slice; loadMore; resetPaging; clearSearchResults; setFilters/clearAllFilters trigger resetPaging when applicable.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` — Status line "Showing X–Y of Z"; Load next button / loading / End of results; resultsScrollRef and scroll-to-top on Sort and Clear all filters; handleReset calls clearSearchResults.
- `packages/ui/src/stores/jobSearchV1Store.test.ts` — beforeEach includes paging fields; tests for runSearch slice, loadMore append, filter reset paging.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.test.tsx` — Reset test uses clearSearchResults; new test for totalCount/results slice after loadSampleJobs.
- `packages/ui/src/stores/pathAdvisorScreenOverridesStore.ts` — Optional helperParagraph and onFitBriefingPrimaryAction for Job Search overrides.
- `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorCard.tsx` — isFitBriefing branch for fit briefing (jobTitle, stars, reasons); generic briefing keeps sourceLabel/sections.
- (Plus V1 base from feature branch: filter-guides, JobSearchScreen V1, mock jobs/checklists, FilterDropdown, fitScoring, tooltipCopy, decisionBriefs/targetRole/pathAdvisor stores, promptToFiltersParser.)

## Commands run summaries

- **git status** — On branch feature/job-search-load-more-pagination-v1. Staged + unstaged changes (V1 base + paging).

## Manual checks

- Results pane shows "Showing 1–20 of N" (or "0 results" when totalCount 0).
- Load more appends next 20 without breaking selection/details pane.
- Filters/sort reset to first page; results pane scrolls to top when changing Sort or clicking Clear all filters.
- Scrolling remains stable (results pane scrolls independently; no page-level scroll trapping).

# Job Search — Hover and filter state sync v1

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/job-search-hover-and-filter-state-sync-v1.)

## What changed

1. **Job results list hover + selection affordance**  
   JobListItem: entire row is the click target for selection (row div has onClick → onSelect). Hover: background `var(--p-surface2)` via local hover state (onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave); cursor pointer. Selected: existing subtle background + left 3px accent bar `var(--p-accent)`. Focus-visible: inner content div has tabIndex={0}, focus-visible:ring-2 ring-[var(--p-accent)] for keyboard nav. Save and "Why this fit?" buttons call stopPropagation so they don’t trigger selection. No layout shift (3px left border in both selected and unselected).

2. **Series filter state sync (single source of truth)**  
   Canonical store field: `jobSearchV1Store.filters.series`. Series dropdown value reads directly from store: `value={store.filters.series !== undefined && store.filters.series !== '' ? store.filters.series : ''}`. Series guide drawer `onApplySeries` writes to the same store (setFilters with next.series = seriesCode, then runSearch). No redundant local React state; dropdown is fully controlled by store. "All Series" normalized as empty string in value; clearAllFilters resets filters to {} so series becomes undefined and dropdown shows "All Series".

3. **Visible applied-state feedback**  
   Series trigger label shows the selected code (e.g. "2210") when store.filters.series is set; "Clear all filters" resets to "All Series". No extra "Active filters" chip row (kept minimal).

4. **Tests**  
   Store: jobSearchV1Store.test.ts — "setFilters with series sets filters.series and persists; clearAllFilters resets series". JobSearchScreen.test.tsx — "Series dropdown reads from store" (asserts state.filters.series after setState).

## Files changed (this run)

- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` — JobListItem: row click target, hover state, cursor-pointer, focus-visible on content div; Save/Why this fit stopPropagation; Series dropdown value normalized (empty string for All); comment on single source of truth for drawer.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.test.tsx` — New test: Series dropdown reads from store (store.filters.series after setState).
- `packages/ui/src/stores/jobSearchV1Store.test.ts` — New test: setFilters with series, persist, clearAllFilters resets series.
- `docs/merge-notes.md` — This section (hover + series sync).

## Commands run summaries

- **git status** — On branch feature/job-search-hover-and-filter-state-sync-v1. Modified: JobSearchScreen.tsx, JobSearchScreen.test.tsx, jobSearchV1Store.test.ts.
- **git branch --show-current** — feature/job-search-hover-and-filter-state-sync-v1.
- **git diff --name-status HEAD** — M JobSearchScreen.tsx, M JobSearchScreen.test.tsx, M jobSearchV1Store.test.ts.
- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm test** — Passed (757 tests, 53 files).
- **pnpm routes:check** — OK (all Sidebar routes resolve in Desktop and Next).
- **pnpm overlays:check** — Passed (Overlay Rule v1 / OverlayRoot).

## Manual checks

- Hover job rows shows highlight (background var(--p-surface2)).
- Selected row is obvious (left accent bar + background).
- Selecting series in drawer updates Series dropdown immediately (label shows e.g. "2210").
- Clear all filters resets series label to "All Series".

## Human Simulation Gate

# Job Search — Filter guides polish v1

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/job-search-guides-polish-v1.)

## What changed

1. **Drawer vertical layout**  
   FilterGuideDrawer: drawer container is column flex with full height. Results wrapper uses `flex flex-col` and `flex-1 min-h-0`; the list scroller uses `flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-y-auto` (removed `max-h-[50vh]`) so content uses full available height above the footer with no clipping.

2. **Scrollbar styling (desktop)**  
   ScrollbarsStyle.tsx: added scope `[data-scroll-container="filter-guide-drawer"]` with the same dark scrollbar rules as main and pathos (Chromium + Firefox). Drawer list div has `data-scroll-container="filter-guide-drawer"` so its scrollbar matches desktop (dark, token-safe).

3. **Row hover + keyboard affordances**  
   Series rows: `cursor-pointer`; hover background `var(--p-surface)` via onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave; `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[var(--p-accent)]` for keyboard nav. No selected-row state (optional left accent omitted to keep minimal).

4. **Drawer visual hierarchy (token-safe)**  
   Header: stronger typography (`text-base font-semibold tracking-tight`), consistent padding (`px-4 py-3`), border `var(--p-border)`. Search block: spacing tightened (`space-y-2`, `pb-2`). Category chips: `gap-2 items-center`. Table header row: `font-medium`, sticky, `var(--p-border)`. All dividers use `var(--p-border)`.

5. **De-clutter guide affordances**  
   Replaced "Series guide" / "Agency guide" / "Location guide" text links with one consistent small icon button (BookOpen) to the right of each filter trigger (Series, Agencies, Location). Tooltips: "Open series guide...", "Open agency guide...", "Open location picker...". Buttons: 7×7, token border/surface/text-muted, aria-label. No separate "?" icons; tooltips on the icon button only.

## Files changed (this run)

- `packages/ui/src/components/filter-guides/FilterGuideDrawer.tsx` — Layout (flex-1 min-h-0 scroller), scroll container attribute, row hover/focus styles, header/search/chips/table hierarchy.
- `packages/ui/src/shell/ScrollbarsStyle.tsx` — New scope `filter-guide-drawer` for dark scrollbar; header comment updated.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` — BookOpen import; Series/Agencies/Location each wrapped in `<span className="flex items-center gap-1">` with FilterDropdown + Tooltip + icon button; removed three text links.

## Commands run summaries

- **git status** — On branch feature/job-search-guides-polish-v1. Modified: docs/merge-notes.md, packages/ui/package.json, JobSearchScreen.tsx, ScrollbarsStyle.tsx, pnpm-lock.yaml. Untracked: packages/ui/src/components/filter-guides/.

## Manual checks

- Drawer list uses full height, not cut off (scroller expands to bottom above footer).
- Drawer scrollbar matches desktop (dark, same as main/pathos).
- Row hover highlight is obvious (background change on hover).
- Guide icons feel integrated (one BookOpen per filter, no text links in the way).
- Drawer still portaled correctly and not clipped (OverlayRoot; no Tailwind z-*).

# Job Search — Filter guides drawer v1

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/job-search-filter-guides-drawer-v1.)

## What changed

1. **FilterGuideDrawer component**  
   New right-side drawer panel (portaled overlay) in `packages/ui/src/components/filter-guides/`. Uses Radix Dialog portaled to OverlayRoot; token-only styling (var(--p-*)); shared zIndex constants (no Tailwind z-*). Header (title + close), search input, category chips, results list with scroll, footer helper "Click a row to apply to filters.", Close button. Accessible: focus trap, ESC closes, aria labels.

2. **Series & role guide (full)**  
   Deterministic local dataset `seriesGuideData.ts`: 15 entries (seriesCode, title, typicalRoles, commonGrades, category). Pure `filterSeriesGuide(data, query, category)` for search (seriesCode/title/typicalRoles, case-insensitive) and category filter. "Series guide" button next to Series filter opens drawer titled "Series & role guide"; selecting a row applies that series to filters, closes drawer, calls `store.runSearch()`.

3. **Agency and Location guides (stubs)**  
   "Agency guide" and "Location guide" buttons next to those filters. Clicking opens same drawer with stub title and message "Agency guide (coming next)" / "Location picker (coming next)." Data interfaces in `filterGuideTypes.ts`: AgencyGuideEntry (id, name, aliases, parentAgency?), LocationGuideEntry (id, label, aliases, type: metro|state|remote).

4. **Tooltip**  
   Series guide button tooltip: "Browse common federal series codes and apply one to your search."

## Files changed (this run)

- `packages/ui/package.json` — Added @radix-ui/react-dialog.
- `packages/ui/src/components/filter-guides/seriesGuideData.ts` — New: SERIES_GUIDE_DATA, SERIES_CATEGORIES, filterSeriesGuide.
- `packages/ui/src/components/filter-guides/seriesGuideData.test.ts` — New: unit tests for filterSeriesGuide (2210 → IT Management, category filter).
- `packages/ui/src/components/filter-guides/filterGuideTypes.ts` — New: FilterGuideKind, AgencyGuideEntry, LocationGuideEntry.
- `packages/ui/src/components/filter-guides/FilterGuideDrawer.tsx` — New: portaled drawer (series full UI, agency/location stubs).
- `packages/ui/src/components/filter-guides/FilterGuideDrawer.test.tsx` — New: smoke tests (component renders without throwing).
- `packages/ui/src/components/filter-guides/index.ts` — New: barrel export.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` — filterGuideKind state; Series/Agency/Location guide buttons; FilterGuideDrawer; onApplySeries → setFilters + runSearch; Series guide tooltip.

- **pnpm overlays:check** — Passed (Overlay Rule v1 / OverlayRoot). Comment in FilterGuideDrawer.tsx adjusted so " z-" does not appear (overlays script matches substring in file).

## Manual checks (to verify)

- Open Series guide → drawer not clipped by scroll panes or rail; scroll works inside drawer.
- Select a series row → filter updates (Series dropdown); results refresh (runSearch).
- Drawer closes with ESC and Close button.
- Agency guide / Location guide open drawer with stub "coming next" message.
- overlays:check passes.

# Job Search — Tooltips v1

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/job-search-tooltips-v1.)

## What changed

1. **Centralized tooltip copy map**  
   Added `packages/ui/src/lib/tooltipCopy.ts` exporting `chipTooltips`, `sortTooltips`, `fitTooltips`, `filterGroupTooltips`, and helpers `getChipTooltip`, `getSortTooltip`, `getFilterGroupTooltip`. Copy for chips (GS, close date, Closes soon, Remote, Telework, appointment types, Clearance, Drug test, Travel), fit signals (fit stars, confidence, effort), sort options (likelihood, effortToReward, strategic, urgency), and filter groups (Sort, Grades, Series, Agencies, Location, Types). All strings ≤ 140 chars.

2. **Chips/tags wrapped with canonical Tooltip**  
   Job list rows: grade, close date, Remote/Telework, risk (Travel/Drug test/Clearance), fit stars, confidence chip, "Why this fit?" link, Save icon — each wrapped in `Tooltip` with copy from tooltipCopy. Details panel: FitStarsRow (fit stars + confidence), effort chip, risk chips (Overview and PathOS Brief), Save button, View on USAJOBS link. Applied-from-prompt "View" and "Clear all filters" button have tooltips. Tooltips use existing overlay container (OverlayRoot); no inline `role="tooltip"` DOM; no Tailwind z-*.

3. **Filter/sort dropdown tooltips**  
   `FilterDropdown` accepts optional `tooltip?: string`. When set, a small Info icon is rendered next to the trigger; hovering the icon shows the tooltip. JobSearchScreen passes `getSortTooltip(sortBy)` for Sort dropdown and `getFilterGroupTooltip('Grades')` etc. for Grades, Series, Agencies, Location, Types so each filter group has an explainer.

4. **Icon button tooltips**  
   Save/bookmark in list ("Save job" / "Saved to your list"), details Save button ("Save job and create PathOS Brief" / "Saved to your list"), View on USAJOBS ("Open full announcement on USAJOBS in your browser"), Why this fit? ("Open fit briefing for this job (fit score, reasons, next steps)"), Clear all filters ("Remove all filter selections (grades, series, agency, location, type)").

5. **Minimal test**  
   `packages/ui/src/lib/tooltipCopy.test.ts` — verifies chipTooltips/sortTooltips/fitTooltips and getters return non-empty strings (and ≤ 140 chars where asserted), getChipTooltip/getSortTooltip/getFilterGroupTooltip behavior.

## Files changed (this run)

- `packages/ui/src/lib/tooltipCopy.ts` — New: chipTooltips, sortTooltips, fitTooltips, filterGroupTooltips, getChipTooltip, getSortTooltip, getFilterGroupTooltip.
- `packages/ui/src/lib/tooltipCopy.test.ts` — New: tests for tooltip copy module.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` — Import Tooltip + tooltipCopy; wrap list chips (grade, close, remote, risk), fit stars, confidence, Why this fit?, Save icon; wrap details FitStarsRow, effort, risk chips, Save button, USAJOBS link; tooltip for View (applied from prompt), Clear all filters; pass tooltip to each FilterDropdown.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/_components/FilterDropdown.tsx` — Optional `tooltip` prop; when set, render Info icon next to trigger wrapped in Tooltip; wrapper div for trigger + icon.

# Job Search — Unify search entry v1

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/job-search-unify-search-entry-v1.)

## What changed

1. **Unified search: one pipeline, two entry styles**  
   Manual search + filters remain primary (default). "Describe what you're looking for" is collapsed by default and framed as an optional accelerator: "Describe what you want (optional)" with helper "PathOS will translate it into filters you can review." Clicking the link expands a compact panel (same Translate → Apply flow). No "two methods" feeling; one Search button runs search for both manual and describe lanes.

2. **Collapsed Describe by default**  
   Replaced the always-visible Prompted Filters card with a subtle inline CTA near the main search row: label "Describe what you want (optional)" and microcopy "PathOS will translate it into filters you can review." Expanded panel contains: text input, "Use example prompt" link, "Translate to filters" button; after translation: proposed filter chips, interpretation line, Apply filters / Edit / Discard. No duplicate Search button in the describe panel.

3. **Same search pipeline**  
   Manual: Search button runs search with keywords/location + current filters. Describe: "Translate to filters" produces proposed filters; "Apply filters" sets the same store filters and triggers one automatic runSearch() so results appear immediately. Undo (toast/inline) reverts applied-from-prompt filters.

4. **Applied from prompt + View**  
   When prompt-derived filters are active, a small "Applied from prompt" note with "View" link appears near the filters bar. View shows: original prompt, extracted evidence, proposed filters (auditability). Uses existing PROMPT_TO_FILTERS_AUDIT_KEY for evidence/proposedFilters.

5. **Reset clears full search state**  
   Reset now clears: keywords/location, filters, selectedJobId, proposed preview state, appliedFromPrompt indicator, and view-audit open state. Does not wipe saved jobs or decision briefs.

6. **Token-only styling; scroll and overlay rules unchanged**  
   Results pane scrolls, details pane scrolls, PathAdvisor rail fixed with internal scroll. Overlay Rule v1: portaled dropdowns/tooltips; no inline tooltip DOM; no Tailwind z-*.

## Files changed (this run)

- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` — Describe panel collapsed by default (describePanelExpanded state); inline CTA "Describe what you want (optional)" near search row; expanded panel has Translate to filters / Apply filters (no Search in panel); Apply runs store.runSearch() and shows Undo; Reset clears selectedJobId, proposed, viewAuditOpen, showUndoAppliedPrompt; AppliedFromPromptViewPanel shows prompt + evidence + proposed filters (reads from PROMPT_TO_FILTERS_AUDIT_KEY); import storageGetJSON for View panel.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.test.tsx` — Tests: prompt panel collapsed by default (CTA or loading), single Search button when mounted, manual search runSearch hasSearched, applyProposedFiltersFromPrompt + runSearch sets filters and appliedFromPrompt, Applied from prompt indicator when set, Reset clears selectedJobId/appliedFromPrompt/filters.

## Commands run (summaries)

- **git status** — On branch feature/job-search-unify-search-entry-v1; modified: docs/merge-notes.md, JobSearchScreen.tsx, JobSearchScreen.test.tsx (plus existing modified/untracked from prior branch).
- **git branch --show-current** — feature/job-search-unify-search-entry-v1.
- **git diff --name-status develop...HEAD** — N/A (no develop in repo). **git diff --name-status main...HEAD** — includes JobSearchScreen.tsx, JobSearchScreen.test.tsx, and other branch files.
- **git diff --stat develop...HEAD** — N/A. **git diff --stat main -- .** — 22 files (cumulative from main; this run touched JobSearchScreen.tsx, JobSearchScreen.test.tsx, docs/merge-notes.md).
- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm test** — Passed (735 tests, 50 files).
- **pnpm routes:check** — OK (all Sidebar routes resolve in Desktop and Next).
- **pnpm overlays:check** — Passed (Overlay Rule v1 / OverlayRoot).

## Manual checks

- Page feels like one search system; prompt flow is clearly "translate to filters."
- No duplicate search buttons (only the main Search button).
- Results/details/rail scrolling still correct.
- Overlays are not clipped.
- Describe panel is collapsed by default; clicking "Describe what you want (optional)" expands it.
- Translate → Apply sets filters and runs search; results appear; "Applied from prompt" + View visible; Reset clears everything including applied-from-prompt.

# Job Search — Results list reduce clickable v1

(Do not commit or push. Branch: feature/job-search-results-list-reduce-clickable-v1.)

## What changed

1. **Results list as a real selectable listbox**  
   Each row is a single full-width click target (main button) plus an optional trailing Save icon. Clicking anywhere on the row selects the job. Selected row: left accent bar (`3px solid var(--p-accent)`) and subtle background (`var(--p-surface2)`). List container has `role="listbox"`, each row `role="option"` and `aria-selected`.

2. **Consistent row height and reduced content**  
   Rows use `min-h-[88px]` and fixed layout: title (1 line, truncate), meta line (Agency • Location, truncate), chips row (GS + Close date + Remote/Telework + at most one Risk chip), Fit: star indicator + confidence mini chip + "Why this fit?" link. Removed from list rows: fit reasons sentences, "Save + Start Tailoring" big CTA, any expanded "Why this fit" panel. Primary CTA lives in the details pane only.

3. **Chips token-safe**  
   Neutral (default), urgency (close soon — uses `var(--p-accent-bg)` / `var(--p-accent)`), risk (same as neutral). No hardcoded colors.

4. **"Why this fit?" → PathAdvisor briefing**  
   Replaced inline expander with a small "Why this fit?" link in the row. On click, a deterministic fit briefing payload is dispatched to the PathAdvisor briefing store (`type: 'fit'`, jobId, stars, confidence, reasons, inputsUsed, missingInputs, isJobSaved). PathAdvisor rail shows a "Fit explanation" section when briefing is fit type: stars, confidence, top 2–3 reasons, inputs used/missing, and one CTA (Save + Start Tailoring or Tailor resume). Overrides store has `onFitBriefingPrimaryAction` so Job Search can wire save + nav when the user clicks the rail CTA.

5. **Primary CTA in details pane**  
   "Save + Start Tailoring" / "Saved" and "Tailor resume" remain in the details pane action bar. List row has only the compact Save icon.

6. **Workspace viewport unchanged**  
   Results pane scrolls, details pane scrolls, rail fixed; token-only styling; Overlay Rule v1 (portaled dropdowns/tooltips, no inline tooltip DOM, no z-* for overlays).

## Files changed (this run)

- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` — JobListItem refactored to listbox row (full-row button + save icon), compact content, chips (GS, close date, remote/telework, one risk), "Why this fit?" opens PathAdvisor fit briefing; removed whyFitJobId state and inline "Why this fit" panel; overrides set with onFitBriefingPrimaryAction; details primary button label "Save + Start Tailoring".
- `packages/ui/src/stores/pathAdvisorBriefingStore.ts` — Added PathAdvisorBriefingFit and PathAdvisorBriefingPayload union; openBriefing accepts payload; isFitBriefing type guard.
- `packages/ui/src/stores/pathAdvisorScreenOverridesStore.ts` — Added optional onFitBriefingPrimaryAction to overrides.
- `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorCard.tsx` — Renders "Fit explanation" when briefing.type === 'fit' (stars, confidence, reasons, inputs, CTA); uses overrides.onFitBriefingPrimaryAction for CTA.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.test.tsx` — Tests for listbox/option/min-height when results shown, PathAdvisor fit briefing store (type fit, isOpen), saveJob no-throw.

## Commands run (summaries)

- **git status** — On branch feature/job-search-results-list-reduce-clickable-v1; modified: docs/merge-notes.md, JobSearchScreen.tsx, JobSearchScreen.test.tsx, PathAdvisorCard.tsx, pathAdvisorBriefingStore.ts, pathAdvisorScreenOverridesStore.ts (plus jobSearchMockJobs from prior); untracked: fitScoring*, decisionBriefsV1Store*, targetRoleV1Store*.
- **git branch --show-current** — feature/job-search-results-list-reduce-clickable-v1.
- **git diff --name-status develop...HEAD** — N/A (no develop in repo). **git diff --name-status main -- . ':(exclude)artifacts'** — 22 files (JobSearchScreen, PathAdvisorCard, pathAdvisorBriefingStore, pathAdvisorScreenOverridesStore, etc.).
- **git diff --stat develop...HEAD** — N/A. **git diff --stat main -- .** — 22 files changed, 6321 insertions, 2990 deletions (includes prior branch work).
- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm test** — Passed (729 tests, 50 files).
- **pnpm routes:check** — OK (all Sidebar routes resolve in Desktop and Next).
- **pnpm overlays:check** — Passed (Overlay Rule v1 / OverlayRoot).

## Manual checks (recommended)

- Results list scrolls, details scrolls, rail fixed.
- Row selection is obvious and full-row clickable.
- No "expanded panel" appears under filters when clicking "Why this fit?"; PathAdvisor rail shows Fit explanation briefing when triggered.
- List rows feel calmer and less cluttered (no fit reasons or big CTA in each row).
- Save icon in row and "Save + Start Tailoring" in details pane both work; Save persists (create-button rule).

# Job Search — Workspace scroll v1

(No commit or push. Branch: feature/job-search-workspace-scroll-v1.)

## What changed

1. **Fixed-height workspace viewport under filter bar**  
   Screen root: `flex flex-col h-full min-h-0 w-full` so it fills the shell. Top controls (title, toast, Prompted Filters card, search row, sort/filters bar, view-audit, why-fit panel) wrapped in a `flex-shrink-0` section so they stay above the workspace. The results+details grid sits in a workspace section with `flex-1 min-h-0` (CRITICAL so the flex child can shrink and panes get a fixed height).

2. **Results and details panes independently scrollable**  
   Workspace grid: `flex-1 min-h-0` with same column sizes. Results pane: outer column `h-full min-h-0`; inner list wrapper `h-full min-h-0 overflow-y-auto` with `overscroll-behavior: contain`. Details pane: outer column `h-full min-h-0`; JobDetailsPanel already `flex-1 flex-col min-h-0` with tab content `overflow-y-auto`. Both columns scroll internally; expanding content does not resize the whole page.

3. **Sticky action bar in details panel**  
   Details panel action bar (Save job, Tailor resume, Ask PathAdvisor, View on USAJOBS) uses `position: sticky; bottom: 0` with `background: var(--p-surface)` and `border-top: var(--p-border)` so primary actions stay visible when scrolling long details.

4. **Scroll Invariant v1**  
   The workspace viewport is the fixed-height job board area; no trapped scrolling on the page root. PathAdvisor rail remains fixed and scrolls internally (unchanged). Token-only styling; overlay rule v1 unchanged (dropdowns/tooltips portaled).

## Files changed

- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` — Screen root `h-full`; top controls wrapped in flex-shrink-0; workspace section flex-1 min-h-0; results column and inner list h-full min-h-0 overflow-y-auto overscroll-behavior contain; details column h-full min-h-0; JobDetailsPanel action bar sticky bottom with token background/border.

## Commands run and results

- **git status** — On branch feature/job-search-workspace-scroll-v1; modified: JobSearchScreen.tsx, docs/merge-notes.md (plus existing untracked/modified from prior branch).
- **git branch --show-current** — feature/job-search-workspace-scroll-v1. (No develop in repo; branch created from feature/job-search-layout-scroll-fit-tabs-v1.)
- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm test** — Passed (726 tests, 50 files).
- **pnpm routes:check** — OK (all Sidebar routes resolve in Desktop and Next).
- **pnpm overlays:check** — Passed (Overlay Rule v1 / OverlayRoot).

## Manual checks (expected)

- With many jobs, the left results list scrolls independently and does not resize the whole page.
- With long details (e.g. Requirements or Overview), the details panel scrolls internally.
- Top controls (prompt, search, filters, sort) stay visible above the workspace viewport.
- Action bar (Save job, Tailor resume, View on USAJOBS) stays visible at bottom of details panel when scrolling details (sticky).
- Expanding content (e.g. "Why this fit?" or "View" audit) does not break layout; if any expander currently increases page height awkwardly, it should be converted to overlay/drawer per existing overlay system (no change in this run).
- PathAdvisor rail remains fixed and scrolls internally.

# Job Search — Layout, Scroll, Fit Stars, Tabs v1

(No commit or push. Branch: feature/job-search-layout-scroll-fit-tabs-v1.)

## What changed

1. **Layout width ratio**  
   Results column: `clamp(480px, 38vw, 560px)`. Details column: `minmax(420px, 1fr)`. Job list wider; details panel can be smaller. No overall max-width constraint on this screen; `w-full` with consistent padding.

2. **Page scroll behavior**  
   Single main scroll container; PathAdvisor rail stays fixed. Removed fixed heights and inner `overflow-y-auto` on the results list so the page scrolls vertically. Results list is normal flow; details panel tab content keeps `overflow-y-auto` only for long tab body. Main wrapper: `flex flex-col min-h-0 w-full`.

3. **Fit indicator — stars (1–5)**  
   Added `fitScoreToStars(score: 0–100)` in `fitScoring.ts` (deterministic bands: 80+ → 5, 60–79 → 4, 40–59 → 3, 20–39 → 2, 0–19 → 1). Replaced "Strong/Moderate/Stretch fit" text with star display: "★★★★☆" (★/☆) and confidence as separate lightweight chip (Low/Medium/High). JobListItem and PathOS Brief tab use stars; "Why this fit?" panel uses `FitStarsRow`. Kept 2–3 reasons as explainability.

4. **Removed "Translate to plain English"**  
   Toggle and all references removed from the details pane. Requirements tab shows raw checklist items only. Deleted `toPlainEnglishChecklistItem` and `plainEnglishRequirements` state.

5. **Tabs order + naming**  
   Order: (1) **Overview & Docs** (default selected), (2) **Requirements**, (3) **PathOS Brief** (renamed from "Design Brief" / "Decision Brief"). Default tab is `overview`. PathOS Brief tab: fit stars + confidence, top risks chips, effort estimate, 3 next actions checklist; compact, no paragraphs. "Decision Brief" wording in toast changed to "PathOS Brief created."

6. **Dropdowns**  
   Existing `FilterDropdown` remains portaled and token-styled (Overlay Rule v1). No changes; verified themed and not clipped.

## Files changed (this run)

- `packages/ui/src/lib/fitScoring.ts` — Added `fitScoreToStars(score)`; export.
- `packages/ui/src/lib/fitScoring.test.ts` — Added test for `fitScoreToStars` (0–100 → 1–5).
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` — Layout grid (clamp/minmax), single page scroll (no overflow on results column), `FitStarsRow` component, JobListItem stars + confidence chip, PathOS Brief tab (stars, risks, effort, next actions), tab order Overview & Docs first/default, Requirements, PathOS Brief; removed plainEnglish toggle and state; removed `toPlainEnglishChecklistItem`.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.test.tsx` — Test label "PathOS Brief tab content fields" (was "Decision Brief").
- `docs/merge-notes.md` — This section.

## Commands run (summaries)

- **git status** — On branch feature/job-search-layout-scroll-fit-tabs-v1; modified: docs/merge-notes.md, JobSearchScreen.tsx, JobSearchScreen.test.tsx, jobSearchMockJobs.ts; untracked: fitScoring*.ts, decisionBriefsV1Store*.ts, targetRoleV1Store.ts.
- **git branch --show-current** — feature/job-search-layout-scroll-fit-tabs-v1.
- **git diff --name-status main...HEAD** — (branch was created from feature/job-search-career-intel-layer-v1; no develop branch in repo.)
- **git diff --stat develop...HEAD** — N/A (no develop). **git diff --stat main -- . ':(exclude)artifacts'** — 21 files (see repo state).
- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm test** — Passed (726 tests, 50 files).
- **pnpm routes:check** — OK (all Sidebar routes resolve in Desktop and Next).
- **pnpm overlays:check** — Passed (Overlay Rule v1 / OverlayRoot).

## Manual checks (recommended)

- At ~1366px width: results list is not cramped, details still readable.
- Whole page scrolls; no trapped scroll panes in results list.
- Overview & Docs is the default tab and first in order.
- No "Translate to plain English" remains.
- Fit uses stars (e.g. ★★★★☆) and is quick to read; confidence shown separately.
- Dropdown menus (Sort, filters) are themed and not clipped by the rail.

## Human Simulation Gate

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Required | No |
| Triggers hit | none (layout, scroll, UI labels, tab order; no new persistence or create actions) |

# Job Search Career Intelligence Layer v1

(No commit or push. Branch: feature/job-search-career-intel-layer-v1.)

## What changed

1. **Fit Intelligence Layer on each JobCard**  
   Each result card shows: Strong/Moderate/Stretch fit badge, confidence chip (Low/Medium/High), 2–3 plain-English reasons, primary CTA "Save + Start Tailoring", secondary "Why this fit?" (opens structured explanation panel). One-row risk-flag chips (Travel, Drug test, Clearance) when present. "Brief ready" indicator when a decision brief exists for that job.

2. **Decision Brief (auto-generated on Save)**  
   Local-only, deterministic artifact. On Save: create/update record in `pathos_decision_briefs_v1`; toast "Saved. Decision Brief created."; switch details tab to Decision Brief. Brief contains: fit verdict + confidence, key risks (chips), effort estimate, primary gap, recommended resume emphasis (1–2 bullets), 3 Next Actions checklist, "Based on: …" inputsUsed.

3. **USAJOBS Overview → Key Facts grid + Risk Flags**  
   Details panel has tabs: **Decision Brief** (default after Save), **Requirements**, **Overview & Docs**. Overview & Docs tab: 2-column Key Facts grid (Grade, Pay range, Schedule, Remote, Promotion potential, Appointment type), Risk Flags as chips, required documents checklist, "View on USAJOBS" link-first microcopy.

4. **Sorting (decision-driven, deterministic)**  
   "Sort by" dropdown near filters: Likelihood of success (fit score), Effort-to-reward, Strategic value, Urgency (close date). Sort is reproducible. Helper text: "Sorted by X based on Y inputs."

5. **Target Role (local-only)**  
   Store `pathos_target_role_v1`: series, gsTarget, location, remotePreference. "Set target role" CTA in Prompted Filters card opens inline form (Series, GS target, Location, Remote preference). Used by fit scoring for personalized reasons.

6. **Requirements tab: "Translate to plain English" toggle**  
   Template-based short summaries of checklist items (no LLM); deterministic.

## Files changed

- `packages/ui/src/screens/jobSearchMockJobs.ts` — Added `JobOverview` and `JobWithOverview`; each mock job has `overview` (openTo, appointmentType, teleworkEligible, remoteJob, workSchedule, travelRequired, securityClearance, drugTest, financialDisclosure, supervisoryStatus, bargainingUnitStatus, promotionPotential, payRange). `mockSearchJobs` typed to `JobWithOverview[]`.
- `packages/ui/src/lib/fitScoring.ts` — **NEW.** Deterministic `buildFitAssessment`, `effortEstimate`, `strategicValue`, `effortToReward`. Types: FitAssessment, TargetRoleInput, FitProfileInput.
- `packages/ui/src/lib/fitScoring.test.ts` — **NEW.** Tests for series/grade/remote rules, badge + reasons, confidence, effort/strategic/effortToReward.
- `packages/ui/src/stores/targetRoleV1Store.ts` — **NEW.** localStorage key `pathos_target_role_v1`; fields series, gsTarget, location, remotePreference.
- `packages/ui/src/stores/decisionBriefsV1Store.ts` — **NEW.** localStorage key `pathos_decision_briefs_v1`; `buildDecisionBriefRecord`, saveBrief, getBrief, hasBrief. DecisionBriefRecord includes fitAssessment, effortEstimate, strategicValue, effortToReward, keyFactsSummary, risks, nextActions, resumeEmphasis.
- `packages/ui/src/stores/decisionBriefsV1Store.test.ts` — **NEW.** save/load and overwrite behavior.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` — JobListItem: fit badge, confidence, reasons, risk flags, "Save + Start Tailoring", "Why this fit?". Details panel: tabs Decision Brief / Requirements / Overview & Docs; Decision Brief content; Requirements with plain-English toggle; Overview Key Facts grid + Risk Flags. Sort dropdown (Likelihood, Effort-to-reward, Strategic, Urgency). Target role modal (Set target role). Save creates brief, toast, switch to Decision Brief. Why-fit explanation panel. Toast message UI.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.test.tsx` — Extended: loadSampleJobs store state, saveBrief/getBrief, decision brief record fields.

## Validation commands (summarize results)

- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm test** — Passed (725 tests, 50 files).
- **pnpm routes:check** — OK (all Sidebar routes resolve).
- **pnpm overlays:check** — Passed (Overlay Rule v1 / OverlayRoot).

## Manual test checklist

- Load sample jobs → see fit badge + confidence + reasons on cards.
- Save + Start Tailoring → decision brief created; toast "Saved. Decision Brief created."; details tab switches to Decision Brief; refresh → brief still present. Verify localStorage keys: `pathos_decision_briefs_v1`, `pathos_job_search_v1`, existing saved-jobs key.
- Sort by each option (Likelihood, Effort-to-reward, Strategic, Urgency) → order changes deterministically.
- Set target role (Series, GS target, Location, Remote) → fit reasons update.
- "Why this fit?" → explanation panel shows fit + reasons + inputsUsed.
- Overlay sanity: dropdowns (Sort, filters) and tooltips not clipped by rail.

# Job Search v1 — Layout, Executive Briefing, Token Dropdowns

(No commit or push. Validation run and summary below.)

## What changed

1. **Layout width ratio + spacing (Scope A)**  
   Main content area is a 2-column grid: left (results) `minmax(340px, min(460px, 400px))`, right (details) `minmax(560px, 1fr)`. Scroll Invariant preserved with `min-h-0`. Padding and section spacing in the details card aligned with executive card rhythm (p-4, space-y-5, line-height token).

2. **Job details reformat — executive briefing (Scope B)**  
   Details card refactored into: (1) **Header block**: job title (primary), agency + location (secondary), meta chips row (GS, Close date, Remote/Telework, Series if present), 1–2 line summary (muted); (2) **Requirements block**: specialized experience checklist with Check icon, skills & keywords as chips in a wrap grid, documents needed compact checklist; (3) **Action bar** pinned to bottom: Save job (primary), Tailor resume (secondary), Ask PathAdvisor (secondary via `AskPathAdvisorButton`), View on USAJOBS. Token-only styling; no long paragraphs.

3. **Filter dropdowns — token-styled, portaled (Scope C)**  
   Reusable `FilterDropdown` in `packages/ui/src/screens/_components/FilterDropdown.tsx`: Radix DropdownMenu, portaled to OverlayRoot (getOverlayContainer), token styling (`var(--p-surface)`, `var(--p-border)`, `var(--p-shadow-elev-1)`, hover `var(--p-surface2)`), zIndex from `zIndex.ts` (Z_POPOVER). Applied to all five filters: Grades (GS-9..GS-15 + All Grades), Series (2210, 0343, 0301, 1102 + All Series), Agencies (derived from MOCK_JOBS + All Agencies), Location (derived from MOCK_JOBS + Any Location), Types (Competitive, Excepted, Term + All Types). Fifth filter uses store `appointmentType` (Types); no Tailwind z-*; Overlay Rule v1 satisfied.

## Files changed

- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` — grid layout, JobDetailsPanel executive briefing, FilterDropdown for all 5 filters; filter option constants and agency/location derived from MOCK_JOBS.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/_components/FilterDropdown.tsx` — new: token-styled portaled dropdown (Radix DropdownMenu, OverlayRoot, zIndex).
- `packages/ui/src/stores/jobSearchV1Store.test.ts` — added test: setFilters then runSearch returns filtered results by gradeBand.
- `docs/merge-notes.md` — this section.

## Commands run + results

- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm test** — Passed (711 tests, 48 files).
- **pnpm routes:check** — OK (all Sidebar routes resolve).
- **pnpm overlays:check** — Passed (Overlay Rule v1 / OverlayRoot).

## Manual checks (recommended)

At 1280–1440px width: (1) results list feels breathable (left column 340–400px), (2) details panel reads like a briefing (header, requirements blocks, pinned action bar), (3) filter dropdown opens and is themed (surface, border, shadow) and not clipped by the rail; dark mode appearance correct.

## Human Simulation Gate

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Required | No |
| Triggers hit | none (layout, styling, filter UI; store filter state already tested) |
| Why | No new create/save/delete actions; filter selection updates existing store and is covered by store test. |

## Validation commands (run and record results)

**pnpm lint**  
Exit code 1. Failures are in `apps/desktop/dist/` (require() forbidden) and other pre-existing locations; not introduced by this pass. The only change in our files was removing unused `ThemeVariant` import in SharedDashboardRouteShell (fixed). Warnings policy: only hard failures block; dist/ and artifact lint are pre-existing.

**pnpm typecheck**  
Root `tsc -p tsconfig.json` fails with pre-existing errors (artifacts/, apps/desktop/electron, components referencing `@/app/dashboard/resume-builder/page`). `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p packages/ui/tsconfig.json` passes. No new type errors in Pass 1 files.

**pnpm build**  
Passed. Next.js production build completed; /dashboard and other routes built successfully.

**pnpm test**  
Tests exist and run; suite is large (includes artifacts/ and node_modules zod tests). Run was started; pre-existing failures observed (e.g. invalid hook call in artifacts/verify-shared-parity-2, job-storage localStorage). Not required to pass for scaffold-only Pass 1 per testing-standards (optional for pure UI-only changes). Recorded as: run started, many suites pass; some pre-existing failures; no new tests added this pass.

## Human Simulation Gate

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Required | No |
| Triggers hit | none |
| Why | Pass 1 scaffold only: no store logic, persistence, or create/save/delete actions. |

## AI Acceptance Checklist

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Flow | N/A (scaffold only). |
| Store(s) | None. |
| Storage key(s) | None. |
| Failure mode | Dashboard or rail would show placeholder content only. |
| How tested | Manual: load /dashboard and verify sections and rail render. |

## Files changed

- `app/(shared)/dashboard/_components/SharedDashboardRouteShell.tsx` — stub anchor context for PathAdvisorRail
- `app/(shared)/dashboard/page.tsx` — Weekly briefing button callback, Explainer modal scaffold
- `docs/merge-notes.md` — fresh header and logs (prior archived to docs/merge-notes/merge-notes-dashboard-command-center-v1.md)
- `packages/ui/src/index.ts` — export PathAdvisorAnchorContext
- `packages/ui/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` — Command Center layout (Today's Focus, Active Tracks, Signals, empty state, optional Weekly briefing)
- `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorRail.tsx` — optional anchorContext, Do now / Explain why rail buttons with tooltips

## Dashboard route used

**app/(shared)/dashboard/page.tsx** — shared dashboard route updated in place. Shell and nav unchanged (SharedDashboardRouteShell, SharedAppShell).

## Theme confirmation

No theme changes. No modifications to global theme tokens, tailwind config, globals.css, or shared styling. All new UI uses existing theme tokens (var(--p-*)) and existing components (ModuleCard, Dialog from app/ui). No hardcoded Tailwind colors, hex, custom shadows, or new typography.

---

## Dashboard Command Center v1 – Mockup parity

Goal: Match v0 screenshots (docs/mockups/dashboard-command-center-v1-top.png, dashboard-command-center-v1-bottom.png). Route updated in place: app/(shared)/dashboard/page.tsx. No SharedAppShell / PathAdvisor rail layout structure changes. No theme drift; no hardcoded colors. Minimal diffs.

### Summary of changes

1. **Dashboard content (mockup parity)**  
   - **Briefing:** 4 compact tiles (Saved Jobs, Tracked Apps, Readiness, Next Milestone) with subtext.  
   - **Today's Focus:** Hero card (2 col) with "Your next best move", reason, CTA "Fix resume gap", inline Explain expander, badge "Step 1 of 3"; right side 2 small focus cards (Decode latest status, Tighten questionnaire alignment).  
   - **Your Active Tracks:** Saved Jobs (3 items + status/time), Applications (2 items + status chips + date), Resume (progress meter, checklist, "Open Resume Builder" button).  
   - **Signals:** Updates since last visit (5 items + icons/timestamps), Readiness deltas (3 items +/− and explanation), Timeline estimates (disclaimer, "Explain methodology" collapsible).

2. **Weekly briefing button**  
   Near top right of dashboard content; opens modal with script preview (6–10 lines), buttons Regenerate script, Edit script; Generate video disabled with tooltip "Coming soon". Modal uses existing Dialog/Tooltip patterns.

3. **Mock data**  
   Single file `lib/dashboard/mockDashboardData.ts` drives UI; no store wiring in this pass. App passes `mockDashboardData` to `DashboardScreen` as `data` prop.

4. **PathAdvisor rail**  
   Replaced generic prompts with 3 dashboard-relevant quick prompts: "What should I focus on first today?", "Why did my readiness score change?", "When can I expect a referral decision?"

## Dashboard parity fixes + Scroll Invariant v1

Goal: Dashboard Command Center v1 parity fixes and Scroll Invariant v1 in a single pass. No theme drift; minimal diffs; no commit/push.

### Summary of changes

- **Part 0:** Created `docs/ui/ui-contract.md` with section "Scroll Invariant v1" (single primary scroll container, main canvas scrolls, rail fixed, no double scrollbars).
- **Part 1:** Today's Focus layout: 3-column grid; hero left anchor `col-span-2 row-span-2`; both right cards stacked in column 3 (Decode top-right, Tighten/Start bottom-right).
- **Part 2:** State-aware focus cards: when `trackedAppsCount === 0` show "Track an application" (CTA Track → /import); when no guided-apply context show "Start Guided Apply" (CTA Start → /desktop/usajobs-guided). Driven by mock data (data.applications.length, optional hasGuidedApplyContext prop). Tooltips added for new/changed CTAs.
- **Part 3:** Removed external FOCUS card above PathAdvisor; PathAdvisor rail structure unchanged (no separate container above it).
- **Part 4:** Verified mock parity: "Last updated" in section headers, hero "Step 1 of 3" badge, hero Explain expand/collapse (What PathOS knows / does not know / why recommended), Timeline disclaimer and "Explain methodology" collapsible — all present.
- **Part 5:** Scroll Invariant v1 in shared shell: outer container `h-screen overflow-hidden`; main layout `min-h-0`; main content `flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden` and `data-scroll-container="main"`. Dashboard content scrolls in main; PathAdvisor rail fixed.
- **Part 6:** Sidebar Guided Apply href updated from `/guided-apply` to `/desktop/usajobs-guided`.

```

**pnpm lint**
```text
Exit code 1. Failures in apps/desktop/dist/ (require() forbidden) and other pre-existing locations. No new errors introduced in changed files (SharedDashboardRouteShell, DashboardScreen, AppShell, PathAdvisorRail, Sidebar, docs/ui).
```

**pnpm typecheck**
```text
FAIL. Root tsc has pre-existing errors (resume-builder/page, electron, artifacts). No new type errors in this pass. packages/ui typechecks if run in isolation.
```

### Files changed (this run)

- `docs/ui/ui-contract.md` — new; Scroll Invariant v1 section.
- `app/(shared)/dashboard/_components/SharedDashboardRouteShell.tsx` — removed stub anchorContext from PathAdvisorRail.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` — Today's Focus 3-col grid (hero col-span-2 row-span-2, right cards col 3); state-aware first/second right card; FocusSmallCard ctaTooltip; FocusHeroCard className.
- `packages/ui/src/shell/AppShell.tsx` — Scroll Invariant v1: h-screen overflow-hidden, main min-h-0, main data-scroll-container="main" overflow-x-hidden.
- `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorRail.tsx` — removed external FOCUS card (anchor context block) above PathAdvisorCard.
- `packages/ui/src/shell/Sidebar.tsx` — Guided Apply href `/guided-apply` → `/desktop/usajobs-guided`.

### Confirmations

- Today's Focus grid: hero is left anchor (col-span-2 row-span-2); both right cards stacked in right column (Decode top-right, Tighten/Start bottom-right); they do not drop below hero at typical desktop widths.
- State-aware focus: when no tracked apps, first right card shows "Track an application" / Track → /import; when no guided-apply context, second right card shows "Start Guided Apply" / Start → /desktop/usajobs-guided.
- External Focus card above PathAdvisor removed; PathAdvisor structure unchanged.
- Dashboard scroll: main content region is the single scroll container; rail fixed; no double scrollbars (Scroll Invariant v1).

### Patch artifacts (baseline: origin/main; origin/develop not in repo)

## Dashboard polish pass (structured explain + hero density + last updated)

**Branch:** feature/dashboard-command-center-v1  

**Summary of changes**

1. **Explain / multi-point blocks (token-safe separators)**  
   - **Hero Explain expander** (FocusHeroCard): Content split into three clearly separated sections (What PathOS knows; What PathOS does not know; Why this is recommended). Faint separators between sections using `borderTop: 1px solid var(--p-border)` and consistent spacing.  
   - **Timeline methodology**: Methodology text split by double newlines into paragraphs; each paragraph in its own row with a faint top border between rows (same token). Single paragraph unchanged visually.

2. **Hero card content density**  
   - Compact sub-block under the main reason with up to three small items: **Estimated time**, **Why it matters**, **What you'll do**. Optional fields on `DashboardData.focusHero`; rendered only when present. No new styling system; existing tokens and spacing only.  
   - Mock data extended with `estimatedTime: '15–20 min'`, `whyItMatters`, `whatYoullDo` for the focus hero.

3. **Last updated label**  
   - Section headers take optional `lastUpdated?: string`. When missing or empty, the "Last updated" label is hidden (no "—" shown).  
   - `DashboardData` and mock: added `lastUpdated?: string`. Mock sets `lastUpdated: '2m ago'` so section headers show "Last updated: 2m ago" in mock mode.

**Constraints respected:** No global theme or CSS token changes; no hardcoded colors/hex; existing components and tokens only; diffs localized to dashboard components; no `var` (let/const only).

**Files changed**

| File | Summary |
|------|--------|
| `packages/ui/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` | SectionHeader optional lastUpdated; FocusHeroCard explain sections with dividers + density block (estimatedTime, whyItMatters, whatYoullDo); Timeline methodology split into rows with separators; DashboardData + focusHero types extended. |
| `lib/dashboard/mockDashboardData.ts` | FocusHero interface + MockDashboardData: optional estimatedTime, whyItMatters, whatYoullDo, lastUpdated; mock focusHero and root lastUpdated populated. |

**Diff stat (this pass, relevant paths)**  
`git diff --stat HEAD -- packages/ui/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx lib/dashboard/mockDashboardData.ts`  
(see repo state; build verified with `pnpm build`.)

**Validation:** `pnpm build` passed. No new lint/typecheck errors introduced beyond known repo issues.

---

## Dashboard row dividers parity

**Goal:** Add faint row dividers everywhere needed for dashboard list-card parity; token-safe; minimal diffs. No theme drift, no hardcoded colors/hex; existing tokens/components only; no `var` (let/const only).

### Summary

1. **CardRowList helper**  
   New reusable component at `packages/ui/src/screens/_components/CardRowList.tsx`. Renders children as vertical rows and inserts a faint divider between each row (not before the first). Divider uses `var(--p-border-light)` (no Separator in @pathos/ui). Props: `children`, optional `className`.

2. **Cards updated to use CardRowList**  
   - **Signals — Updates since last visit:** Divider between each update row.  
   - **Signals — Readiness deltas:** Divider between each delta row.  
   - **Signals — Timeline estimates:** Faint divider between disclaimer and timeline rows; divider between each timeline row.  
   - **Hero card micro-brief:** Estimated time / Why it matters / What you'll do structured as 3 rows with faint dividers between them (wrapper keeps top border from main content).  
   - **Saved Jobs:** Divider between each job row.  
   - **Applications:** Divider between each application row.  
   - **Resume:** Divider between each checklist row (improves scanability).

3. **Validation**  
   - `pnpm build` passed.  
   - No new lint/typecheck errors beyond known repo issues.

### Git state (this run)

**Branch:** `feature/dashboard-command-center-v1`

**Files changed (row-dividers pass):**  
- `packages/ui/src/screens/_components/CardRowList.tsx` (new, untracked)  
- `packages/ui/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` (modified: import CardRowList; FocusHeroCard micro-brief, SavedJobsCard, ApplicationsCard, ResumeCard, UpdatesSinceVisitCard, ReadinessDeltasCard, TimelineEstimatesCard use CardRowList)

**Diff name-status (vs main, exclude artifacts):**  
(Existing branch diff; new file `_components/CardRowList.tsx` is untracked and not in diff. Run `git status` to see untracked.)

**Diff stat (vs main, code paths):**  
See prior merge-notes sections for full branch stat. This pass adds one new file and edits `DashboardScreen.tsx` only.

## Divider softness + row spacing polish

**Goal:** Soften dashboard row dividers and improve row spacing without theme drift. No global theme/token changes; no hardcoded colors/hex; minimal diffs localized to the row-list helper and its usages.

### Summary

- **CardRowList** (`packages/ui/src/screens/_components/CardRowList.tsx`):  
  - **Divider:** Inset (`mx-3`), 1px height (`h-px`), token-safe `var(--p-border)` with opacity 0.22. Replaced border-top with a dedicated div so opacity control is straightforward; dividers are no longer full-width/table-like.  
  - **Row spacing:** Each row wrapped in a container with `py-2` and `leading-5` for breathing room and comfortable line-height.  
- **Usages (unchanged):** All existing dashboard list sections already use CardRowList, so they automatically get the updated styling: Updates since last visit, Readiness deltas, Timeline estimates, Saved Jobs, Applications, Resume checklist, and Focus hero density block (estimated time / why / what).

### Validation

- `pnpm build` passed.
- No new lint/typecheck issues; no `var` (let/const only); divider color is `var(--p-border)` only.

### Affected files and diff stat

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/ui/src/screens/_components/CardRowList.tsx` | Divider: inset mx-3, h-px, var(--p-border) opacity 0.22; row wrapper: py-2 leading-5. |

## Dashboard: Ask PathAdvisor briefing (replaces inline explain)

**Goal:** Move dashboard deep explanations into the PathAdvisor rail (no inline expansion); rename “Explain” CTAs to “Ask PathAdvisor”; keep layout stable.

### Summary

- **PathAdvisor Briefing store** (`packages/ui/src/stores/pathAdvisorBriefingStore.ts`): Zustand store with `briefing`, `isOpen`, and actions `openBriefing`, `closeBriefing`, `clearBriefing`. No persistence; SSR-safe.
- **PathAdvisorCard**: Renders a “PathAdvisor Briefing” section inside the existing card (above quick prompts) when the store has an open briefing. Header with close (X) button and tooltip; optional source line; sections with faint inset separators (`var(--p-border)`, opacity 0.6). Single scroll inside the card; no double scrollbars.
- **Dashboard hero (Today’s Focus):** Inline “Explain” expanded block removed. Micro-brief (Estimated time / Why it matters / What you’ll do) stays inline. CTA changed to “Ask PathAdvisor”; click calls `openBriefing` with title “Why this is your next best move” and sections (What PathOS knows / does not know / Why this is recommended). Tooltip: “Opens PathAdvisor briefing for this recommendation.”
- **Timeline card:** “Explain methodology” replaced with “Ask PathAdvisor”; inline methodology expansion removed. Click opens briefing “How PathAdvisor estimates timelines” with sections: Data is historical, Ranges vary, No guarantees, What signals matter. Tooltip: “Ask PathAdvisor: methodology” and description.
- **Layout:** Clicking “Ask PathAdvisor” does not change dashboard height; only the PathAdvisor rail content updates.

### Files changed (this run)

- `packages/ui/package.json` — add zustand dependency
- `packages/ui/src/stores/pathAdvisorBriefingStore.ts` — new store (briefing state + actions)
- `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorCard.tsx` — Briefing section inside card, close button + tooltip
- `packages/ui/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` — remove inline explain; hero + timeline “Ask PathAdvisor” + openBriefing; tooltips
- `packages/ui/src/index.ts` — export usePathAdvisorBriefingStore, PathAdvisorBriefing, BriefingSection

### Confirmations

- **Inline expansion removed; dashboard does not shift:** Hero and Timeline no longer expand content inline; “Ask PathAdvisor” only updates the rail.
- **“Ask PathAdvisor” opens briefing inside existing PathAdvisor card:** Briefing renders inside PathAdvisorCard above quick prompts, with close control.
- **Timeline “Ask PathAdvisor” works:** Opens same briefing UI with timeline methodology sections.

### Validation

- **pnpm build:** Passed (Next.js production build; /dashboard and routes built).
- **pnpm typecheck:** Root `tsc` has pre-existing errors (electron, resume-builder). `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p packages/ui/tsconfig.json` passes. No new type errors in changed files.
- **pnpm lint:** Run started; pre-existing failures elsewhere. No new errors in packages/ui or dashboard flow.

## Branded AskPathAdvisorButton

**Summary:** "Ask PathAdvisor" is now a branded signature button using the PathAdvisor emblem (Sparkles, same as rail header), label "Ask PathAdvisor" (with space), secondary/outline style, and optional tooltip with optional shortcut hint. No theme drift; no new colors; existing tokens and patterns only.

**Files changed:**

- `packages/ui/src/components/AskPathAdvisorButton.tsx` — **NEW**. Reusable component: onClick, disabled, size, className, tooltipText, shortcutHint, tooltipId. Sparkles icon (14–16px) left of label "Ask PathAdvisor"; default tooltip "Opens a PathAdvisor briefing for this recommendation."; icon aria-hidden, visible text preserved.
- `packages/ui/src/index.ts` — Export `AskPathAdvisorButton` and `AskPathAdvisorButtonProps`.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` — Today's Focus hero and Timeline card "Ask PathAdvisor" buttons replaced with `<AskPathAdvisorButton />`; hero uses default tooltip and tooltipId `focus-hero-ask-pathadvisor-tooltip`; timeline uses custom tooltipText and tooltipId `timeline-ask-pathadvisor-tooltip`. No layout change; briefing behavior unchanged.

**Diff stats (this section only):** 1 new file, 2 modified (index, DashboardScreen). Keyboard shortcut not implemented (no existing keybinding pattern in packages/ui); tooltip supports optional `shortcutHint` for future use.

## Routing parity fix (Next 3000 vs Desktop 5173)

**Goal:** Permanent routing parity and single source of truth for screens so Sidebar links work in both Next (3000) and Desktop (5173); shared screens in packages/ui; no duplication.

### Merge-notes process (required)

### Files changed (this run)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/ui/src/routes/routes.ts` | **NEW** — Shared route constants (DASHBOARD, COMPENSATION, BENEFITS, RETIREMENT, CAREER, RESUME_BUILDER, JOB_SEARCH, SAVED_JOBS, GUIDED_APPLY_CANON, GUIDED_APPLY_ALIAS, EXPLORE_BENEFITS, ALERTS, IMPORT, SETTINGS). |
| `packages/ui/src/shell/Sidebar.tsx` | Import and use route constants for all hrefs and tourMap; no behavioral change. |
| `apps/desktop/src/DesktopApp.tsx` | Add /desktop/usajobs-guided → GuidedApplyScreen; /guided-apply → Navigate to canonical; add routes for /dashboard/compensation, /dashboard/benefits, /dashboard/retirement, /explore/benefits, /alerts, /import with PlaceholderScreen. |
| `app/guided-apply/page.tsx` | **NEW** — Redirect to /desktop/usajobs-guided via next/navigation redirect(). |
| `packages/ui/src/screens/PlaceholderScreen.tsx` | **NEW** — Shared "Coming soon" + Back to Dashboard button; token-safe. |
| `packages/ui/src/screens/dashboard/mockDashboardData.ts` | **NEW** — Shared mock data; shape matches DashboardData. |
| `packages/ui/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` | Use mockDashboardData when props.data not provided; import from ./dashboard/mockDashboardData. |
| `packages/ui/src/index.ts` | Export PlaceholderScreen, PlaceholderScreenProps, mockDashboardData. |
| `app/(shared)/dashboard/page.tsx` | Thin wrapper: remove mockDashboardData import and data prop; DashboardScreen uses internal mock. |
| `lib/dashboard/mockDashboardData.ts` | Re-export mockDashboardData from @pathos/ui (shim). |
| `docs/architecture/routing-contract.md` | **NEW** — Rules: wrappers only, all Sidebar hrefs resolve, canonical Guided Apply, shared screens in packages/ui, route constants in routes.ts. |

### Confirmations

- **Sidebar hrefs resolve in Desktop:** All Sidebar links either render a real screen (dashboard, career, job-search, saved-jobs, resume-builder, settings, Guided Apply canonical) or PlaceholderScreen (compensation, benefits, retirement, explore/benefits, alerts, import). No 404s.
- **Guided Apply canonical + alias:** Next: /guided-apply redirects to /desktop/usajobs-guided; /desktop/usajobs-guided exists. Desktop: /desktop/usajobs-guided → GuidedApplyScreen; /guided-apply → Navigate to /desktop/usajobs-guided. Sidebar uses GUIDED_APPLY_CANON (/desktop/usajobs-guided).
- **Dashboard mock data shared:** mockDashboardData lives in packages/ui; DashboardScreen defaults to it when no data prop. Next dashboard page no longer injects data; Desktop shows same dashboard content as web.

## Routing parity hardening (automated check + lint ignores)

**Summary:** Added automated route parity check script, `routes:check` pnpm script, and ESLint globalIgnores for `apps/desktop/dist/**`, `artifacts/**`, `_local_artifacts/**` to reduce lint noise. No theme or globals changes; minimal diffs.

(Committed changes on branch vs origin/main; see repo for full list.)

**git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD**
(Branch includes many committed files; stat omitted here. Working tree changes are the parity + lint edits above.)

**Deliverables:**
- `packages/ui/src/routes/routes.ts`: exported `SIDEBAR_ROUTES` for script use.
- `scripts/check-route-parity.mjs`: reads routes.ts, checks DesktopApp.tsx `<Route path="..." />` and app/**/page.tsx for each Sidebar route; exit 1 on mismatch.
- `package.json`: added `"routes:check": "node scripts/check-route-parity.mjs"`.
- `eslint.config.mjs`: globalIgnores extended with `apps/desktop/dist/**`, `artifacts/**`, `_local_artifacts/**`.

**Validation (see command output summary below):**
- `pnpm routes:check` — PASS
- `pnpm build` — (run below)
- `pnpm -r typecheck` — (run below)
- `pnpm lint` — no longer fails on dist/artifacts (ignored).

**Patch artifacts (push-ready):**

## Dashboard Pass 2 – view model + snapshot + PathAdvisor actions

**Goal:** View model, change detection, PathAdvisor wiring in shared layer for Next (3000) and Desktop (5173). No theme drift; minimal diffs; no `var`; dashboard behavior in `packages/ui`.

### Git state (Pass 2)

**git status**
```
On branch feature/dashboard-command-center-v1
Changes not staged for commit:
  modified:   app/(shared)/dashboard/page.tsx
  modified:   apps/desktop/src/DesktopApp.tsx

```

**git diff --name-status origin/main...HEAD**  
(Branch vs main; includes prior commits and working tree.)

**git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD**  
(Summary of changed files and line counts.)

### Files changed (Pass 2)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/ui/src/screens/dashboard/dashboardModel.ts` | Added: FocusItem, ActiveTrack, SignalItem, DashboardViewModel (platform-neutral) |
| `packages/ui/src/screens/dashboard/buildDashboardViewModel.ts` | Added: deterministic builder from DashboardData; max 3 focus, routes from routes.ts, top 3 tracks/signals |
| `packages/ui/src/screens/dashboard/useDashboardSnapshot.ts` | Added: snapshot + change detection; localStorage pathos_dashboard_snapshot_v1, pathos_dashboard_dismissed_focus_v1; SSR-safe |
| `packages/ui/src/stores/dashboardHeroDoNowStore.ts` | Added: hero "Do now" action for PathAdvisor rail |
| `packages/ui/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` | View model driven; visibleFocus (dismissed filtered); hero do-now store; nav.push(actionRoute); dismiss/undo; empty states |
| `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorCard.tsx` | "Do now" quick action inside card (from store); useNav().push(route) |
| `packages/ui/src/index.ts` | Export dashboard view model types, buildDashboardViewModel, useDashboardSnapshot |

### View model rules

- **Focus:** Max 3 items; each has `actionRoute` from `packages/ui/src/routes/routes.ts` (RESUME_BUILDER, IMPORT, GUIDED_APPLY_CANON).
- **Tracks:** Three cards (Saved Jobs, Applications, Resume); statusSummary and route per track; list preview limited (e.g. top 3 items).
- **Signals:** From updatesSinceVisit (top 3), readinessDeltas (top 2), one timeline summary; raw shapes for existing signal cards on DashboardViewModel.

### Snapshot keys

- **pathos_dashboard_snapshot_v1** — Last view model snapshot (focusCount, trackCount, signalCount, lastUpdated, focusIds, signalIds) for "what changed since last visit."
- **pathos_dashboard_dismissed_focus_v1** — Array of dismissed focus item ids (string[]); persisted for recognition-over-recall.

SSR: All localStorage access guarded with `typeof window !== 'undefined'`. Snapshot updated after render (effect with serialized keys).

### No Next-only imports in packages/ui dashboard

Confirmed: No `next/*` or `electron/*` in `packages/ui/src/screens/dashboard/*` or `packages/ui/src/stores/dashboardHeroDoNowStore.ts`. Navigation via `@pathos/adapters` (useNav). Route constants from `packages/ui/src/routes/routes.ts`.

### PathAdvisor wiring

- Hero focus card: Primary CTA uses `actionRoute` and `nav.push(actionRoute)` (useNav from @pathos/adapters).
- PathAdvisor card: "Do now: {label}" button reads from `useDashboardHeroDoNowStore`; on click calls `nav.push(heroDoNow.route)`. Structure unchanged; inside existing PathAdvisor card.

### Dismiss / Undo

- Dismiss on secondary focus items (small cards); optional for hero (not shown on hero in this pass).
- Dismissed ids stored in `pathos_dashboard_dismissed_focus_v1`.
- "Show dismissed" link restores all dismissed (undo); minimal, consistent with existing UI.

### Validation (Pass 2)

**pnpm routes:check**  
Exit code 0. `routes:check: OK — all Sidebar routes resolve in Desktop and Next.`

**pnpm build**  
Exit code 0. Next.js production build completed.

**pnpm -r typecheck**  
Exit code 0. packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop typecheck: Done.

**pnpm lint**  
Lint on touched dashboard/snapshot/store files: 0 errors. Full-repo lint may report pre-existing errors in other files (e.g. PathAdvisorCard set-state-in-effect, GuidedApplyScreen, Sidebar); not introduced by Pass 2.

### Artifacts policy

Patches generated only when push-ready. When ready:
- `git diff origin/main...HEAD > artifacts/dashboard-pass2.patch`
- `git diff > artifacts/dashboard-pass2-this-run.patch`
- `ls -lh artifacts` (log output in merge-notes)

---

## Dashboard Pass 2 polish (stability + calming UX)

**Goal:** Stability and calming UX with minimal diffs; dashboard + PathAdvisorCard only. No theme drift.

### Summary of changes

1. **Hero Do Now robustness (PathAdvisorCard)**  
   When `heroDoNow` is missing or invalid (no route), show a disabled "Do now" button with tooltip "No action selected" instead of hiding. Hero do-now already updates when focus items change (useEffect in DashboardScreen). Added label "From Today's Focus" above the Do now block.

2. **Snapshot messaging (useDashboardSnapshot + DashboardScreen)**  
   "Changed since last visit" still shown only when there are actual changes (focusChangedCount or signalsNewCount > 0). Replaced generic counts with actionable phrasing: "Resume or application focus changed since last visit.", "New timeline or readiness activity since last visit.", or combined. Added "How this works" link next to the summary that opens a PathAdvisor briefing explaining local snapshot logic (storage, privacy, resetting).

3. **Dismiss UX (DashboardScreen)**  
   Only secondary focus cards remain dismissible (unchanged). "Show dismissed" is a subtle link (text-[10px], opacity 0.85). When expanded, dismissed items are listed in a subdued block (border, surface2, muted text) with per-item "Undo". Toggle "Hide dismissed" to collapse.

4. **Empty states (signal cards)**  
   UpdatesSinceVisitCard, ReadinessDeltasCard, and TimelineEstimatesCard each handle empty list: one calm sentence plus one CTA. Updates empty: "No application or job updates yet." + "Track applications" → IMPORT. Readiness empty: "No readiness changes yet." + "Open Resume Builder" → RESUME_BUILDER. Timeline empty: "No timeline estimates yet." + "Open Resume Builder" → RESUME_BUILDER. No empty list rendering; SignalPlaceholderCard removed.

5. **PathAdvisor clarity**  
   Label "From Today's Focus" added above the PathAdvisor "Do now" button.

### Files touched (polish)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorCard.tsx` | Do now: always show block; disabled + tooltip when invalid; "From Today's Focus" label |
| `packages/ui/src/screens/dashboard/useDashboardSnapshot.ts` | Actionable summaryLine phrasing (resume/app/timeline) |
| `packages/ui/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` | SnapshotHowThisWorksLink, DismissedFocusList, showDismissedExpanded, signal card empty states (onNavigate), remove SignalPlaceholderCard |

### Validation (polish)

**pnpm routes:check**  
Exit code 0. PASS.

**pnpm build**  
Exit code 0. PASS.

**pnpm -r typecheck**  
Exit code 0. PASS.

**pnpm lint**  
No new errors in touched files (DashboardScreen.tsx, useDashboardSnapshot.ts). PathAdvisorCard set-state-in-effect remains pre-existing.

## Scrollbar styling + PathAdvisor mark accent

**Goal:** Desktop scrollbar styling consistent with web (dark/black); PathAdvisor emblem yellow accent in rail header and Ask PathAdvisor button. Token-safe, no theme drift.

### Part A — Scrollbar consistency

- **Containers styled:**
  - `[data-scroll-container="main"]` — main content area (AppShell)
  - `.pathos-scroll` — PathAdvisor rail conversation window (PathAdvisorCard)
- **Thumb token:** `var(--p-surface2)` (dark, token-safe). Hover: `var(--p-border-strong)`.
- **Track:** transparent. Chromium: `::-webkit-scrollbar`, `-thumb`, `-track`. Firefox: `scrollbar-width: thin`, `scrollbar-color: var(--p-surface2) transparent`. Width 8px; inset look via border-radius and background-clip.
- **Implementation:** `packages/ui/src/shell/ScrollbarsStyle.tsx` injects scoped `<style>`; included once in AppShell. No global body/html styling.

### Part B — PathAdvisor emblem (yellow accent)

- **Rail header:** ModuleCard already wraps card icons in a span with `color: var(--p-accent)`. PathAdvisorCard passes `<Sparkles />` as icon; no change.
- **Ask PathAdvisor button:** Sparkles wrapped in `<span style={{ color: 'var(--p-accent)' }}>` so emblem uses same accent as rail. Lucide Sparkles uses currentColor.

### Patch artifacts (push-ready)

Generated with baseline `origin/main...HEAD` and working tree diff, excluding `artifacts/`:

**Commands:**
```powershell
git diff origin/main...HEAD -- . ":(exclude)artifacts" | Out-File -Encoding utf8 artifacts/scrollbar-pathadvisor-accent.patch
git diff -- . ":(exclude)artifacts" | Out-File -Encoding utf8 artifacts/scrollbar-pathadvisor-accent-this-run.patch
Get-ChildItem artifacts -Filter "scrollbar-pathadvisor*" | Format-List Name, Length, LastWriteTime
```

**Output:**
```text
Name          : scrollbar-pathadvisor-accent-this-run.patch
Length        : 81074
LastWriteTime : 2/27/2026 9:32:48 PM

Name          : scrollbar-pathadvisor-accent.patch
Length        : 163172
LastWriteTime : 2/27/2026 9:32:48 PM
```

**Summary:** Scrollbars styled only for main content and PathAdvisor conversation region. Thumb color: `var(--p-surface2)`. PathAdvisor emblem accent: `var(--p-accent)` in both rail header (via ModuleCard) and AskPathAdvisorButton.

## Briefing tiles border consistency

**Goal:** Make the top Briefing tiles (Saved Jobs, Tracked Apps, Readiness, Next Milestone) feel intentional: align base border with other cards, keep a subtle briefing-only signature (no full orange outline).

**Changes:**
- **Component:** `BriefingTile` in `packages/ui/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` (renders the 4 briefing tiles in the Briefing row).
- **Base border:** Explicit `1px solid var(--p-border)` and `borderRadius: var(--p-radius-lg)`, `boxShadow: var(--p-shadow-elev-1)` to match ModuleCard/card chrome. No full orange accent outline.
- **Briefing signature (Option A):** Thin left accent bar inside each tile: 2px `border-left: 2px solid var(--p-accent-muted)` on an inner content wrapper, with `pl-[calc(0.75rem+2px)]` so content does not sit under the bar. Low emphasis; hero focus card remains the most emphasized (ModuleCard with top accent + primary CTA).
- No theme or global CSS changes; tokens only. No `var`; minimal diff.

**Validation:**
- `pnpm build` — pass.
- `pnpm -r typecheck` — pass.

**Diff stats (this run):**
- 1 file changed: `packages/ui/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` (BriefingTile only; base border aligned with ModuleCard, 2px left accent bar added).

## Commit split: artifacts cleanup + dashboard feature

- `git branch --show-current`: `feature/dashboard-command-center-v1`
- `git log -2 --oneline`:
  - `f91b7aa chore: ignore artifacts and remove tracked patch dumps`
  - `567b8d0 feature/dashboard-command reworked the dashboard accordingly`
- `git status`: staged feature files only; no staged `artifacts/**/*.patch` and no staged `artifacts/verify-shared-parity-*` paths.

Validation commands and results:
- `pnpm routes:check` -> pass (`routes:check: OK — all Sidebar routes resolve in Desktop and Next.`)
- `pnpm build` -> pass (Next.js build succeeded; baseline-browser-mapping staleness warnings only)
- `pnpm -r typecheck` -> pass
- `pnpm test packages/ui/src/screens/dashboard/buildDashboardViewModel.test.ts packages/ui/src/screens/dashboard/useDashboardSnapshot.test.ts packages/ui/src/stores/dashboardHeroDoNowStore.test.ts` -> pass (3 files, 10 tests)

## Application Confidence Center v1 — Pass 1 (Scaffold only)

**Branch:** Use current branch (no branch change). No commit or push.

**Scope:** New route/screen for Application Confidence Center using existing SharedAppShell and PathAdvisor rail. Layout: list of tracked applications (empty state with CTA), main area with three placeholder cards (Status Intel with Explain button, Next Best Moves, Timeline Forecast). Add tracked application dialog scaffold; Explainer Video modal scaffold (script preview placeholder, generate disabled). PathAdvisor rail receives stub anchor context from selected tracked app. Zero theme drift; existing UI primitives and tooltip pattern only.

### Files changed

| File | What / why |
|------|------------|
| `packages/ui/src/screens/ApplicationConfidenceCenterScreen.tsx` | New screen: layout, empty state, Add CTA, SimpleModal scaffolds for Add tracked application and Explainer Video; inline tooltips on Explain and Add buttons; onAnchorContextChange callback for rail. |
| `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorRail.tsx` | Added `PathAdvisorAnchorContext` type and `anchorContext` prop; rail passes derived `viewingLabel` to PathAdvisorCard when anchor context is set. |
| `packages/ui/src/shell/Sidebar.tsx` | Added nav item "Application Confidence Center" under CAREER & JOBS with href `/application-confidence-center`, icon Target. |
| `packages/ui/src/index.ts` | Exported ApplicationConfidenceCenterScreen, ApplicationConfidenceCenterScreenProps, ApplicationConfidenceAnchorContext; PathAdvisorAnchorContext. |
| `apps/desktop/src/DesktopApp.tsx` | New route `/application-confidence-center` rendering ApplicationConfidenceCenterScreen with onAnchorContextChange; state pathAdvisorAnchorContext; PathAdvisorRail receives anchorContext (stub from selected app). |
| `docs/merge-notes.md` | This section: files changed, what/why, commands run, patch artifact. |

### Commands run

Validation commands to run (outputs pasted after running): `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (if tests exist and are fast), `pnpm build`.

### Patch artifact

- `artifacts/app-confidence-center-pass1-this-run.patch` — incremental diff for this run (HEAD to working tree, excludes artifacts/). Generate with:  
  `git diff --binary HEAD -- . ":(exclude)artifacts" | Out-File -FilePath artifacts/app-confidence-center-pass1-this-run.patch -Encoding utf8`  
  (PowerShell). If the repo uses cumulative day patches, also run `pnpm docs:day-patches --day <N>` for the current day.

**Patch Artifacts (FINAL) — this run**

Command: `git diff --binary HEAD -- . ":(exclude)artifacts" | Out-File -FilePath artifacts/app-confidence-center-pass1-this-run.patch -Encoding utf8`

Get-Item output:
```
Name          : app-confidence-center-pass1-this-run.patch
Length        : 29014
LastWriteTime : 2/26/2026 11:59:28 PM
```

### Validation commands (summary)

- **pnpm lint** — Run at repo root; may include pre-existing warnings/errors in other packages. New code: `packages/ui` ApplicationConfidenceCenterScreen and desktop route introduce no new lint errors (unused `selectedApp` removed).
- **pnpm typecheck** — Root `tsc -p tsconfig.json` has pre-existing errors (electron experiments, resume-builder, app paths). `pnpm --filter @pathos/ui typecheck` and `apps/desktop` `tsc --noEmit` both **pass**.
- **pnpm test** — Pre-existing 44 failures in `job-storage.test.ts` (localStorage not defined in node). No new tests added in Pass 1 per task ("skip tests in Pass 1" when no established pattern).
- **pnpm --filter @pathos/desktop build** — **Passed.** Renderer and Electron build complete successfully.

## Merge main into dashboard command center

Merged decisions:
- PathAdvisorAnchorContext standardized to `{ viewingLabel?: string; applicationId?: string }` in shared rail and desktop app wiring.
- Guided Apply canonical route is `/desktop/usajobs-guided`; `/guided-apply` remains alias redirect to canonical path.
- Application Confidence Center preserved and integrated in shared navigation and desktop routing at `/application-confidence-center`.
- Route constants remain the source of truth; sidebar uses constants and includes `APPLICATION_CONFIDENCE_CENTER` in `SIDEBAR_ROUTES`.

## Career & Resume screen (executive command center)

**Branch:** feature/careerAndResume_page_creation (or current branch). **Do not commit or push.**

**Goal:** Implement the Career & Resume screen to match mockups (docs/mockups/careerAndResume_*.png) and current-build styling. Same layout primitives, tokens (var(--p-*)), SectionHeader/ModuleCard/CardRowList patterns as Dashboard. Two-column layout (main scroll + fixed PathAdvisor rail) via existing SharedAppShell; route on existing shared Career route (/dashboard/career) for Next (3000) and Desktop (5173).

### Files changed + why

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/ui/src/stores/pathAdvisorScreenOverridesStore.ts` | **NEW.** Zustand store for per-screen rail overrides (viewingLabel, suggestedPrompts, briefingLabel). CareerScreen sets these on mount so PathAdvisor rail shows "Career & Resume" context and career quick prompts without shell being route-aware. |
| `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorRail.tsx` | Subscribe to pathAdvisorScreenOverridesStore; pass viewingLabel, suggestedPrompts, briefingLabel to PathAdvisorCard when overrides set; else defaults (Dashboard). |
| `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorCard.tsx` | Optional `briefingLabel` prop; when set, show it above the Do now block instead of "From Today's Focus". |
| `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.tsx` | **REPLACED.** Full Career & Resume screen: title row (Career & Resume + microcopy + Local-only badge + Last updated), Today's Best Move hero (primary CTA + Ask PathAdvisor), Resume Readiness 4-tile briefing, Your Resume card (version/status, sections checklist, Open Builder / Duplicate / Export disabled when incomplete), Linter Findings (grouped by severity, calm badges), Tailoring Workspace (job context or empty state, checklist, Start Tailoring disabled when no job with tooltip), Career Narrative (3 bullets + Update narrative / Generate options), Saved Assets (bullet bank, STAR, metrics + add/import mock actions). Demo state at top of file: noResume, incompleteResume, readyResume, tailorReadyWithJob. On mount: set screen overrides and dashboardHeroDoNowStore so rail shows "From Career & Resume", Do now "Complete Resume", and 3 career quick prompts. |
| `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.test.tsx` | **NEW.** Three tests: renders title and key sections; Start Tailoring disabled when demoState not tailorReadyWithJob; Start Tailoring not disabled when tailorReadyWithJob. |
| `packages/ui/src/index.ts` | Export usePathAdvisorScreenOverridesStore and PathAdvisorScreenOverrides. |

### Commands run + results

- **pnpm -r typecheck** — PASS (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm test** — PASS (673 tests, 42 files). CareerScreen.test.tsx: 3 tests pass.
- **pnpm routes:check** — PASS. All Sidebar routes resolve in Desktop and Next.

### Layout and scroll

- Career page uses existing `SharedDashboardRouteShell` (same as dashboard). Main content is inside SharedAppShell’s `<main data-scroll-container="main">`; PathAdvisor rail is fixed. No new routing; career route already wired in app/(shared)/dashboard/career/page.tsx and DesktopApp.tsx.

### PathAdvisor rail (Career context)

- When CareerScreen mounts it sets pathAdvisorScreenOverridesStore (viewingLabel: "Career & Resume", suggestedPrompts: the 3 mockup prompts, briefingLabel: "From Career & Resume") and dashboardHeroDoNowStore (label: "Complete Resume", route: RESUME_BUILDER). Rail shows briefing panel with "From Career & Resume", Do now mirroring hero CTA, and quick prompt chips. On unmount overrides and hero do-now are cleared.

### Styling

- Tokens only (var(--p-*)). ModuleCard, CardRowList, SectionHeader, AskPathAdvisorButton reused. No hardcoded colors. Same section header and card chrome as Dashboard.

### Follow-ups / known gaps

- No backend integration; all data is demo/mock driven by CAREER_DEMO_STATE constant and optional `demoState` prop (for tests).
- Export CareerDemoState from index if consumers need to drive state from URL or settings.
- Human simulation: not required for this pass (no store persistence, no create/save/delete; UI-only with local demo state).

## Resume Readiness screen updates (v0 final)

**Branch:** feature/careerAndResume_page_creation. **Do not commit or push.**

**Goal:** Implement Resume Readiness screen updates per v0 scope: naming, Active resume dropdown, New version actions (duplicate / create tailored), Tailoring Workspace target job picker, All Resumes drawer, calm chip styling. UI + local state only; no backend. Route constants and URLs unchanged.

### What changed

- **A) Naming:** User-facing label "Career & Resume" → "Resume Readiness" everywhere: Sidebar item, page title + subtitle, PathAdvisor rail "Viewing: …" and "From …", and all briefing source labels. Internal route path `/dashboard/career` unchanged.
- **B) Active resume dropdown:** Redesigned to strict grid: left = resume name (truncate), right = two compact chips (Type + Status) and muted "Updated X ago". Group headers "MASTER" and "TAILORED (RECENT)". Footer "Manage resumes…" opens All Resumes drawer. Trigger stays compact (name + chips only, no dates).
- **C) New version menu:** "Duplicate active resume" creates a new entry with "(Copy)" suffix, sets it active, status Draft/In progress, shows toast. "Create tailored version from saved job" opens drawer with searchable saved-job picker (2-line format: title + GS, agency • location • close date); "Create tailored resume" disabled until job selected (tooltip). On confirm: new tailored resume "[Job Title] – GS-X", set active, set Tailoring Workspace target job, toast, scroll to Tailoring Workspace.
- **D) Tailoring Workspace:** Added "Target job" searchable dropdown (saved jobs, same 2-line format). Empty state when no saved jobs: guidance + CTA to Saved Jobs. "Start tailoring" disabled until target job selected, with tooltip.
- **E) All Resumes drawer:** Row layout: left name (truncate), middle two chips (Type + Status), right Set active / Archive. "Updated X ago" on muted second line. Active row shows "Active" indicator and disabled "Active" button instead of "Set active".
- **F) List styling:** Muted chip variants (--p-surface2, --p-text-muted) in dropdowns and drawers; strong emphasis only for primary CTA and active/selected state.

### Files changed

- `packages/ui/src/shell/Sidebar.tsx` — Sidebar label "Career & Resume" → "Resume Readiness".
- `packages/ui/src/stores/pathAdvisorScreenOverridesStore.ts` — Comment updates for viewingLabel/briefingLabel.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.tsx` — Full implementation: store usage, Active resume dropdown (groups + footer), New version menu (Duplicate + Create tailored drawer), Tailoring target job picker, All Resumes drawer, Create tailored drawer, toast, MutedChip, JobOptionRow, TailoringTargetJobPicker. PathAdvisor overrides set to "Resume Readiness". All briefing sourceLabel → "Resume Readiness".
- `packages/ui/src/stores/careerResumeScreenStore.ts` — **NEW.** Local UI state: resumes, activeResumeId, targetJobIdForTailoring, toastMessage; seedFromDemoState, addResume, setActiveResumeId, setTargetJobForTailoring, archiveResume, setToast, resetSeeded. formatUpdatedAgo helper.
- `packages/ui/src/stores/careerResumeScreenStore.test.ts` — **NEW.** Tests: seedFromDemoState (incompleteResume, tailorReadyWithJob), addResume sets active, setTargetJobForTailoring, formatUpdatedAgo.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.test.tsx` — Updated: "Resume Readiness" title/sections; YOUR RESUME + Tailoring + Target job assertions; Start Tailoring disabled; beforeEach reset of careerResumeScreenStore.

### Commands run + pass/fail

- **pnpm -r typecheck** — **PASS** (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm test** — **PASS** (680 tests, 43 files).
- **pnpm routes:check** — **PASS.** All Sidebar routes resolve in Desktop and Next.

### Known follow-ups

- No backend; resume list and target job are in-memory only (careerResumeScreenStore). Persistence can be added later.
- Human simulation not required this run (no persistence keys; create/duplicate/tailored are mock in-memory only).

## Resume Readiness — CSS/copy parity, routing rename, Referral Readiness Check

**Branch:** feature/careerAndResume_page_creation. **Do not commit or push.**

**Goal:** Bring Resume Readiness screen to mockup parity: copy renames (Referral Readiness Check, severity labels), YOUR RESUMES + Active resume label + “Updated X ago” + Edit/Duplicate/Export + “New version” button, canonical route with alias redirect.

### What changed

- **Phase 2 — Copy + naming**
  - Replaced “Linter Findings” with **Referral Readiness Check**: title “REFERRAL READINESS CHECK”, subtitle “Quick issues that could lower your referral odds.” and scope “for &lt;Active Resume Name&gt; • N issues”. Severity labels: **Fix first**, **Improve**, **Optional** (was Must fix / Improve / Optional). Renamed `linterFindings` → `referralFindings`, severity `mustFix` → `fixFirst`.
  - Card **YOUR RESUME** → **YOUR RESUMES**. Added “Active resume” label above dropdown. “Updated X ago” below trigger row (using `formatUpdatedAgo(activeResume.updatedAt)`). Primary action **Edit resume** (was “Open Builder”). Added **Duplicate** button in actions row (duplicate + toast). **+ New version** button with ChevronDown (Duplicate active resume / Create tailored version from saved job). “View all resumes (N)” link when `resumes.length > 1`.
  - Tailoring Workspace card: subtitle **Using: &lt;Active Resume name&gt;** when `activeResume` is set.
- **Phase 3 — Routing**
  - **Canonical route:** `RESUME_READINESS = '/dashboard/resume-readiness'`. Sidebar and `SIDEBAR_ROUTES` use `RESUME_READINESS`.
  - **Alias:** `CAREER = '/dashboard/career'` redirects to `/dashboard/resume-readiness`. Next: `app/(shared)/dashboard/career/page.tsx` now calls `redirect('/dashboard/resume-readiness')`. Desktop: `/dashboard/career` → `<Navigate to="/dashboard/resume-readiness" replace />`. New page `app/(shared)/dashboard/resume-readiness/page.tsx` renders `CareerScreen`.
  - Sidebar `isItemActive`: Resume Readiness item is active when pathname is `RESUME_READINESS` or `CAREER`. Route parity script: `SIDEBAR_ROUTE_NAMES` uses `RESUME_READINESS` instead of `CAREER`.

### Files changed

- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.tsx` — Referral Readiness Check (title, subtitle, severity Fix first/Improve/Optional), YOUR RESUMES, Active resume label, Updated X ago, Edit resume, Duplicate button, + New version button, View all resumes link, Tailoring Workspace subtitle.
- `packages/ui/src/routes/routes.ts` — Added `RESUME_READINESS`, kept `CAREER`; `SIDEBAR_ROUTES` uses `RESUME_READINESS`.
- `packages/ui/src/shell/Sidebar.tsx` — Import `RESUME_READINESS` and `CAREER`; sidebar href and tour use `RESUME_READINESS`; `isItemActive` treats both paths as active.
- `scripts/check-route-parity.mjs` — `SIDEBAR_ROUTE_NAMES`: `CAREER` → `RESUME_READINESS`.
- `app/(shared)/dashboard/resume-readiness/page.tsx` — **NEW.** Renders `CareerScreen` (canonical).
- `app/(shared)/dashboard/career/page.tsx` — Redirect to `/dashboard/resume-readiness` (server component).
- `apps/desktop/src/DesktopApp.tsx` — Route `/dashboard/resume-readiness` → `CareerScreen`; `/dashboard/career` → `Navigate` to resume-readiness.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.test.tsx` — Assert “YOUR RESUMES”, “REFERRAL READINESS CHECK”, “Quick issues that could lower your referral odds”; new test “renders Referral Readiness Check card (not Linter Findings)”.

### Commands run + pass/fail

- **pnpm -r typecheck** — **PASS**
- **pnpm test** — **PASS** (681 tests, 43 files)
- **pnpm routes:check** — **PASS** (all Sidebar routes resolve in Desktop and Next)

### Follow-ups

- Phase 1 (deeper CSS/layout audit vs Dashboard primitives) and Phase 4 (explicit demo toggles for resumeCount / savedJobsCount / showArchivedResumes) were scoped out for minimal diff; can be done in a follow-up.
- `desktop-preview` and any external links to `/dashboard/career` continue to work via redirect.

## Proof Library (Saved Assets → Proof Library)

**Goal:** Improve the “Saved Assets” card on the Resume Readiness screen so users instantly understand its purpose and the layout looks organized and executive-grade.

### What changed + why

- **Rename + reframe:** Card title changed from “Saved Assets” to **“Proof Library”** with subtitle: “Reusable evidence you can drop into bullets and tailoring.”
- **Structured layout:** Replaced three-number layout with a 3-column grid of mini-panels (responsive: stacked on small widths). Each panel has: Label, Count, primary “Add …” button, secondary “View” action. Panels: **STAR stories**, **Bullet bank**, **Metrics**.
- **Import (optional):** “Import from notes” → “Import from notes (optional)” with tooltip: “Paste notes. PathOS can extract bullets, STAR stories, and metrics.” Kept secondary to the three panels.
- **Interactions (mock):** “Add STAR story” / “Add bullet” / “Add metric” open a modal (Title + Content + Save); Save adds item and increments count (local-only state). “View” opens a drawer listing items (or empty state). All behavior local-only; no persistence.
- **Style:** Uses existing tokens (`var(--p-*)`) and Card/Button/Badge/Separator patterns; no hardcoded colors.
- **Tests:** CareerScreen tests updated/added so that “PROOF LIBRARY” and the three panels (STAR stories, Bullet bank, Metrics) are asserted.

### Files changed

- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.tsx` — Proof Library card (title, subtitle, 3 panels with counts and Add/View), Add modal, View drawer, local state and handlers; `ProofLibraryItem` type at module scope.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.test.tsx` — Expectations updated for “PROOF LIBRARY”; new test “renders Proof Library with three panels (STAR stories, Bullet bank, Metrics)” (title, labels, Add buttons, Import optional).
- `docs/merge-notes.md` — This section.

### Commands run + results

- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Exit 0. packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop typecheck passed.
- **pnpm test -- --run** — Exit 0. 43 test files, 682 tests passed (includes CareerScreen.test.tsx, 6 tests).

## Resume Readiness UX fixes (chips, spacing, overlay, archive/delete)

**Goal:** Fix four UX issues on Resume Readiness: (A) meaningfully color-coded resume type/status chips, (B) spacing between name and chips for scannability, (C) “New version” menu above PathAdvisor rail, (D) archive + delete with confirm in All Resumes drawer.

### What changed + why

- **A) Chip meaning (token-safe):** Replaced generic `MutedChip` with **ResumeTypeChip** (Master = neutral/outline `var(--p-surface2)`; Tailored = accent `var(--p-accent-bg)`, `var(--p-accent-muted)`, `var(--p-accent)`) and **ResumeStatusChip** (Ready = success-like `var(--p-success-bg)` + check icon; In progress/Draft = muted). Used in both the active-resume dropdown list items and All Resumes drawer rows. Two chips max: Type + Status.
- **B) Spacing/layout:** Enforced strict layout for dropdown items and drawer rows: name on left, chip group on right, no wrapping. Added consistent horizontal gap (`gap-3`) between name and chips; name truncates (`truncate min-w-0`), chips `flex-shrink-0`.
- **C) Overlay layering:** “New version” dropdown was rendering behind the PathAdvisor rail. It now renders via **createPortal(..., document.body)** with `z-50` so it appears above the rail. Menu position is derived from trigger button `getBoundingClientRect()` when opened.
- **D) Removal actions:**  
  - **Archive:** Per resume row in All Resumes drawer: Archive icon button sets `archived: true` in store (item hidden unless “Show archived” is checked). Toast “Archived.” with **Undo** that calls `unarchiveResume(id)`.  
  - **Delete permanently:** Only in drawer, under a “More” (⋮) overflow menu per row. **Confirm dialog:** title “Delete resume?”, body “This removes the resume from this device. This can’t be undone.”, Cancel / Delete. Delete removes the resume from local mock state and clears active if it was active.  
  - **Show archived:** Checkbox in All Resumes drawer header toggles `showArchived`; when true, archived items are listed.
- **Store:** `CareerResumeEntry` has optional `archived?: boolean`. New actions: `archiveResume` (sets archived, sets toast + `toastUndoResumeId`), `unarchiveResume`, `deleteResume`, `setShowArchived`, `setToastWithUndo`. `resetSeeded` clears `toastMessage`, `toastUndoResumeId`, `showArchived`. Dropdown and “View all resumes” count use **visible** resumes (filter `archived !== true`).

### Files changed

- `packages/ui/src/stores/careerResumeScreenStore.ts` — `archived`, `toastUndoResumeId`, `showArchived`; `archiveResume` (soft), `unarchiveResume`, `deleteResume`, `setShowArchived`, `setToastWithUndo`; `resetSeeded` extended.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.tsx` — ResumeTypeChip, ResumeStatusChip; active row + dropdown rows + drawer rows use new chips and layout; New version menu portaled with createPortal; toast with Undo; All Resumes drawer: Show archived, Archive button, More menu with Delete, delete confirm dialog; `visibleResumes`, `deleteConfirmResumeId`, `drawerRowMoreOpenId`.
- `packages/ui/src/stores/careerResumeScreenStore.test.ts` — Tests: archiveResume sets archived and toast; showArchived reveals archived; unarchiveResume clears archived and toast; deleteResume removes item and clears active.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.test.tsx` — Test: “renders YOUR RESUMES empty state when no resumes (SSR does not seed store)”.

### Commands run + results

- **pnpm -r typecheck:** Passed (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm test -- --run:** Passed. 43 test files, 687 tests. CareerScreen and careerResumeScreenStore tests all pass.

## Resume Readiness UI regressions (row layout, close button, chips, dropdown)

**Goal:** Fix four regressions: (A) All Resumes drawer row too dense — 2-line layout; (B) drawer close button inconsistent; (C) chips semantic styling (token-only); (D) New version dropdown transparent and behind PathAdvisor rail.

### What changed

- **A) All Resumes drawer row layout:** Each row is now a consistent 2-line layout. Line 1: resume name (truncate) left, action right — “Set active” or disabled “Active” (no separate Active chip). Line 2: chips group left (Type + Status only; Archived chip when applicable), “Updated X ago” right. Chips in a compact group that does not wrap.
- **B) Close button consistency:** All Resumes, Proof Library, and Create tailored drawers use a shared close control: Lucide `X` icon, `size-9` icon button, ghost-style hover (`hover:bg-[var(--p-surface2)]`) and focus-visible ring. No raw “×” character; no app Button import (packages/ui stays boundary-safe).
- **C) Chip semantics:** ResumeTypeChip and ResumeStatusChip already use token-only styling (Master = outline/neutral; Tailored = accent; Ready = success + Check icon; In progress/Draft = muted). No code change; validated.
- **D) New version dropdown:** Menu is portaled to `document.body` with overlay at `z-[100]` so it renders above PathAdvisor rail. Menu content uses `backgroundColor: 'var(--p-surface)'` and `z-10` so it has a solid surface and stacks above the overlay backdrop.

### Files changed

- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.tsx` — All Resumes drawer: 2-line row layout, X close button; Proof Library and Create tailored drawers: X close button; New version menu: z-[100], backgroundColor, z-10 on content; Lucide `X` import.

### Commands run + results

- **pnpm -r typecheck:** Passed (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm test:** Passed. 43 test files, 687 tests (including CareerScreen.test.tsx, careerResumeScreenStore.test.ts).

## Resume Readiness UX parity fixes (dropdown, chips, tooltips, confirm)

**Goal:** Finish Resume Readiness UX parity: Active resume dropdown 2-line layout per mockups; chips token-safe and visually distinct; drawer icon tooltips; destructive delete with confirm; archive with Undo toast.

### What changed

1. **A) Active resume dropdown — 2-line layout**
   - Replaced single-row “name | chips | updated” with strict 2-line layout per item:
     - Line 1: left = resume name (truncate), right = chip group (Type + Status), no wrapping.
     - Line 2: “Updated X ago” in muted text, aligned right.
   - Kept group headers (MASTER, TAILORED (RECENT)) and footer “Manage resumes…”.

2. **B) Chips**
   - Verified dropdown and All Resumes drawer use same components: `ResumeTypeChip` (Master/Tailored), `ResumeStatusChip` (Ready/In progress/Draft).
   - Tailored uses accent tokens (`--p-accent-bg`, `--p-accent`); Ready uses success tokens + Check icon; Master neutral/outline. Token-only; no new colors.

3. **C) Drawer icon tooltips**
   - All Resumes drawer: added tooltips for icon actions using existing inline pattern (relative group + `aria-describedby` + sibling `role="tooltip"`):
     - Archive button: “Archive resume”
     - More (⋮) button: “More actions”
   - Delete is only in More menu (no separate icon); menu item label “Delete permanently” is visible.

4. **D) Destructive action and Archive**
   - Delete permanently: confirm dialog already present — title “Delete resume?”, body “This removes the resume from this device. This can’t be undone.”, Cancel / Delete. Only deletes after confirm.
   - Archive: store already performs archive and sets `toastMessage: 'Archived.'` and `toastUndoResumeId`; toast shows Undo that calls `unarchiveResume`. No code change.

### Files changed

- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.tsx` — Dropdown: 2-line item layout (both MASTER and TAILORED sections). Drawer: tooltip wrappers for Archive and More icon buttons (unique ids per row).

### Validation

- **pnpm -r typecheck:** Passed (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm test:** Passed. 43 test files, 687 tests (CareerScreen.test.tsx, careerResumeScreenStore.test.ts included).

### Human Simulation Gate

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Required | No |
| Triggers hit | none |
| Why | UI layout, tooltips, and confirm/undo flows only; store behavior for archive/delete unchanged. |

## All Resumes drawer tooltips: portaled to body, side=left (no commit)

**Goal:** Fix tooltip clipping in the All Resumes drawer by rendering tooltip content via a Radix portal to `document.body` and opening right-edge tooltips to the left (inward) with correct z-index above the drawer.

### What changed

1. **Tooltip implementation**
   - All Resumes drawer rows previously used inline tooltips (relative group + sibling `role="tooltip"` div), which were clipped by the drawer's overflow/stacking context.
   - Replaced with a Radix-based component that portals content to `document.body`: `packages/ui/src/components/DrawerTooltip.tsx`.

2. **DrawerTooltip**
   - Uses `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` (Provider, Root, Trigger, Portal, Content).
   - Content is rendered inside `TooltipPrimitive.Portal` (to `document.body`).
   - For right-edge icon buttons (Archive, More): `side="left"`, `sideOffset={8}`, `collisionPadding={12}`.
   - Tooltip content `zIndex: 50` so it appears above the drawer overlay (drawer uses `z-40`).

3. **CareerScreen**
   - Archive and More icon buttons in the All Resumes drawer now use `<DrawerTooltip content="..." side="left" sideOffset={8} collisionPadding={12}>` wrapping the trigger button; removed inline tooltip divs and `aria-describedby` (Radix manages a11y).
   - More button's dropdown (Delete menu) unchanged; still a sibling of the tooltip wrapper.

### Files changed

- `packages/ui/package.json` — Added dependency `@radix-ui/react-tooltip`: `"latest"`.
- `packages/ui/src/components/DrawerTooltip.tsx` — **New.** Portaled tooltip component (Radix Provider + Root + Trigger + Portal + Content), design tokens, z-index 50.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.tsx` — All Resumes drawer: Archive and More buttons wrapped in `DrawerTooltip`; removed inline tooltip markup.

### Commands run and results

- **pnpm install** — OK (after adding Radix tooltip to packages/ui).
- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm -r test** / **pnpm test** — Passed. 43 test files, 687 tests (including `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.test.tsx`).

### Validation

- **Visual:** Open All Resumes drawer, hover Archive and More; tooltip should be fully visible (not clipped) and open to the left (inward). Confirm manually.
- No commit or push.

---

## Overlay Rule v1 — Centralized z-index, Radix DropdownMenu for “New version” (no commit)

**Goal:** Implement Overlay Rule v1 so DropdownMenu, Tooltip, and Sheet layering is consistent; “New version” dropdown always renders above PathAdvisor with a solid background; no custom createPortal/manual positioning.

### What changed

1. **Z-index scale (packages/ui)**
   - Added `packages/ui/src/styles/zIndex.ts`: `Z_LAYOUT` (10), `Z_POPOVER` (50), `Z_DIALOG` (100), `Z_TOOLTIP` (50). Layout (rail) &lt; popover/tooltip &lt; dialog.

2. **“New version” dropdown (CareerScreen)**
   - Removed custom `createPortal` + manual anchor state (`newVersionMenuAnchor`, `newVersionButtonRef`). Re-implemented with `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`: `DropdownMenuPrimitive.Root`, `Trigger`, `Portal`, `Content`. Content renders in `document.body` via Radix Portal; solid background `var(--p-surface)`, border `var(--p-border)`, `zIndex: Z_POPOVER`.

3. **PathAdvisor rail**
   - `packages/ui/src/shell/AppShell.tsx`: Left and right advisor rail `<aside>` now use `zIndex: Z_LAYOUT` so portaled popovers/dropdowns (Z_POPOVER) always render above the rail.

4. **DrawerTooltip**
   - `packages/ui/src/components/DrawerTooltip.tsx`: Replaced hardcoded `zIndex: 50` with `Z_TOOLTIP` from `../styles/zIndex`.

### Files changed

- `packages/ui/package.json` — Added `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`: `"latest"`.
- `packages/ui/src/styles/zIndex.ts` — **New.** Centralized z-index constants (layout, popover, dialog, tooltip).
- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.tsx` — Removed `createPortal` and anchor state; “New version” uses Radix DropdownMenu + Portal; DropdownMenuContent uses `var(--p-surface)` and `Z_POPOVER`.
- `packages/ui/src/shell/AppShell.tsx` — Rail asides use `Z_LAYOUT`.
- `packages/ui/src/components/DrawerTooltip.tsx` — Uses `Z_TOOLTIP` from zIndex module.

### Commands run and results

- **pnpm install** — OK.
- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm test packages/ui** — 8 test files, 36 tests passed (including `CareerScreen.test.tsx`).
- **pnpm test** — Full suite: 43 test files, 687 tests passed.

### Validation (edge cases)

- **New version menu:** Open near the right edge; must render above PathAdvisor rail with solid background (no transparency).
- **Tooltips near drawer edge:** DrawerTooltip (portaled + Z_TOOLTIP) should not be clipped.

## Overlay Rule v1 enforced globally — shell layering, canonical Tooltip, audit script (no commit)

**Goal:** Enforce Overlay Rule v1 everywhere: all tooltips/popovers/menus portaled to body, z-index from packages/ui/src/styles/zIndex.ts, rails at layout layer. Single canonical Tooltip; overlay audit script to prevent regressions.

### What changed

1. **Shell layering (AppShell)** — PathAdvisor rail asides: added `position: 'relative'` so `zIndex: Z_LAYOUT` takes effect. Mobile sidebar overlay: replaced Tailwind `z-50` with `style={{ zIndex: Z_DIALOG }}`.
2. **Canonical Tooltip** — New `packages/ui/src/components/Tooltip.tsx` (Radix, Portal, Z_TOOLTIP). DrawerTooltip is a thin alias. Replaced inline `role="tooltip"` / absolute div tooltips in AskPathAdvisorButton, PathAdvisorCard (3), SettingsScreen, CareerScreen (2), ApplicationConfidenceCenterScreen. SimpleModal uses Z_DIALOG.
3. **Overlay audit** — New `scripts/check-overlays.mjs`: fails on createPortal( in screens, role="tooltip" in ui (excl. Tooltip/DrawerTooltip), z-[ in ui (excl. zIndex.ts). Added `pnpm overlays:check`.

### Files changed

- `packages/ui/src/shell/AppShell.tsx` — position:relative on rails; Z_DIALOG for mobile overlay.
- `packages/ui/src/components/Tooltip.tsx` — **New.** Canonical portaled tooltip.
- `packages/ui/src/components/DrawerTooltip.tsx` — Thin alias around Tooltip.
- `packages/ui/src/components/AskPathAdvisorButton.tsx` — Tooltip component.
- `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorCard.tsx` — Three Tooltip wrappers.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx` — InlineTooltip uses Tooltip.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.tsx` — Two Tooltip wrappers.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/ApplicationConfidenceCenterScreen.tsx` — InlineTooltip uses Tooltip; SimpleModal Z_DIALOG.
- `scripts/check-overlays.mjs` — **New.** Overlay Rule v1 audit.
- `package.json` — overlays:check script.

### Commands run and results

- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed.
- **pnpm test** — 43 files, 687 tests passed.
- **pnpm overlays:check** — Passed.

## OverlayRoot: global overlay layering fix (no commit)

**Goal:** Fix tooltips and dropdowns rendering behind PathAdvisor rail or getting clipped by introducing a single global overlay host (OverlayRoot) and portaling all overlays into it. Deterministic layering via zIndex.ts.

### What changed

1. **Global overlay host (OverlayRoot)**
   - **packages/ui/src/styles/zIndex.ts:** Added `OVERLAY_ROOT_ID = 'pathos-overlay-root'` and `Z_OVERLAY_ROOT = 1000`. Kept `Z_LAYOUT`, `Z_POPOVER`, `Z_DIALOG`, `Z_TOOLTIP` unchanged.
   - **packages/ui/src/shell/AppShell.tsx:** Rendered a single `<div id="pathos-overlay-root" />` at the end of the shell (outside main layout, inside the root div). Inline styles: `position: 'fixed'`, `inset: 0`, `pointerEvents: 'none'`, `isolation: 'isolate'`, `zIndex: Z_OVERLAY_ROOT`. Overlay host does not block pointer events; portaled content uses `pointerEvents: 'auto'` where needed.

2. **Portal all overlays into OverlayRoot**
   - **packages/ui/src/components/Tooltip.tsx:** Resolve container with `getOverlayContainer()` (OverlayRoot when present, else `document.body`). Pass `container={container}` to `TooltipPrimitive.Portal`. Tooltip content uses `pointerEvents: 'auto'` and `zIndex: Z_TOOLTIP`. DrawerTooltip wraps Tooltip so it inherits the same portal behavior.
   - **packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.tsx:** `DropdownMenuPrimitive.Portal` now receives `container={document.getElementById(OVERLAY_ROOT_ID) || document.body}`. DropdownMenu Content already had solid `backgroundColor: 'var(--p-surface)'`, `borderColor: 'var(--p-border)'`, `zIndex: Z_POPOVER`.

3. **Remove competing z-index sources**
   - Replaced Tailwind z-index classes with inline `style={{ zIndex: ... }}` from zIndex.ts across packages/ui: **CareerScreen** (z-20, z-40, z-50, z-10 → Z_POPOVER or Z_DIALOG), **PathAdvisorCard** (z-30 → Z_POPOVER), **TopBar** (z-50 → Z_DIALOG), **Sidebar** (z-10 → 1 for local nav-item stacking). Rails (AppShell asides) already used `Z_LAYOUT`; no parent wrapper changes needed.

4. **Strengthen scripts/check-overlays.mjs**
   - Scope expanded to **packages/ui/src**, **apps/desktop/src**, **app/(shared)**. Fails if: (1) `className` contains `" z-"` (Tailwind z-index), except allowlisted files (zIndex.ts, AppShell.tsx where " z-" appears only in comments); (2) `role="tooltip"` except in Tooltip.tsx / DrawerTooltip.tsx; (3) `createPortal(` (allowlist empty). **pnpm overlays:check** remains wired at root.

### Files changed (this run)

- `packages/ui/src/styles/zIndex.ts` — OVERLAY_ROOT_ID, Z_OVERLAY_ROOT.
- `packages/ui/src/shell/AppShell.tsx` — OverlayRoot div; import OVERLAY_ROOT_ID, Z_OVERLAY_ROOT.
- `packages/ui/src/components/Tooltip.tsx` — getOverlayContainer(); Portal container; Content pointerEvents: auto.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.tsx` — DropdownMenu Portal container; Z_DIALOG, Z_POPOVER; all Tailwind z-* replaced with inline zIndex.
- `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorCard.tsx` — z-30 → Z_POPOVER (inline).
- `packages/ui/src/shell/TopBar.tsx` — z-50 → Z_DIALOG (inline).
- `packages/ui/src/shell/Sidebar.tsx` — z-10 → inline zIndex: 1 (nav item stacking).
- `scripts/check-overlays.mjs` — Scope ui + desktop + app/(shared); fail on " z-", role="tooltip", createPortal( with allowlists.

### Commands run and results

- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm test** — 43 test files, 687 tests passed.
- **pnpm overlays:check** — Passed (Overlay Rule v1 / OverlayRoot).

### Git state (reference)

- **git status** — Branch feature/careerAndResume_page_creation; modified and untracked files as per current working tree.
- **git branch --show-current** — feature/careerAndResume_page_creation.
- **git diff --name-status main --** (overlay-related): M packages/ui/package.json, M packages/ui/src/components/AskPathAdvisorButton.tsx, M packages/ui/src/shell/AppShell.tsx, M packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorCard.tsx, M packages/ui/src/shell/Sidebar.tsx, M packages/ui/src/shell/TopBar.tsx, M packages/ui/src/screens/ApplicationConfidenceCenterScreen.tsx, M packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.tsx, M packages/ui/src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx, etc. (Full diff not pasted.)
- **git diff --stat main --** — (not pasted per instructions.)

### Manual validation (proof)

- PathAdvisor header tooltips (clear chat, settings, close briefing): must not be clipped; must appear above rail.
- “New version” dropdown near right edge: must render above PathAdvisor rail with solid background.
- All Resumes drawer row icon tooltips: must not be clipped.
- At least one tooltip near viewport edge: collision behavior should avoid cutoff.

## Dropdown placement + Resume Readiness tile accent (Mar 1, 2025)

### What changed and why

1. **New version dropdown placement (Task A)**  
   The “New version” menu stays portaled (no revert of portal/OverlayRoot). Positioning was adjusted so the menu anchors to the button and minimizes overlap with the PathAdvisor rail: `side="bottom"`, `align="end"`, `sideOffset={8}`, `collisionPadding={14}`, and a reasonable width range (`min-w-[12rem] max-w-[16rem]` with `w-56`). Radix will prefer flipping left/inward when the menu would collide with the rail.

2. **Resume Readiness tiles accent (Task B)**  
   The four tiles (Completeness, Missing fields, Tailor-ready, Last tailored) previously used a hard 2px solid left border (`borderLeft: '2px solid var(--p-accent-muted)'`). This was replaced with the app’s “fade accent” pattern: an absolute inner strip (8px wide) with a horizontal gradient `linear-gradient(90deg, var(--p-accent-muted), transparent)` and a vertical mask so the strip fades at top/bottom. All four tiles use the same `ResumeReadinessTile` component, so accent behavior is identical. Styling is token-only (`var(--p-*)`).

### Files changed

- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.tsx` — New version `DropdownMenuPrimitive.Content` props (side, align, sideOffset, collisionPadding, width classes); `ResumeReadinessTile` inner content: removed solid border, added fade-accent div (gradient + mask).

### Commands run and results

- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed (packages/adapters, packages/core, packages/ui, apps/desktop).
- **pnpm --filter @pathos/ui test --run** — Passed (exit code 0).

### Constraints respected

- Portal/OverlayRoot behavior unchanged.
- Token-only styling; no hardcoded colors.
- Minimal diffs (targeted edits only).

## Resume Readiness tiles: remove orange strip, match card system (Mar 1, 2025)

### Problem

The four “Resume Readiness” tiles (Completeness, Missing fields, Tailor-ready, Last tailored) had an inconsistent orange left-edge accent (vertical gradient strip) and did not match the styling of other cards on the page (e.g. TODAY'S BEST MOVE, YOUR RESUMES, ModuleCard).

### Goal

Make all four tiles visually consistent with each other and with the rest of the card system on Resume Readiness.

### What changed

1. **Component/style identified**  
   The four tiles are rendered by `ResumeReadinessTile` in `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.tsx`.

2. **Vertical orange gradient strip removed**  
   The inner absolute div that drew an 8px left strip with `linear-gradient(90deg, var(--p-accent-muted), transparent)` and a vertical mask was removed entirely. No left accent bar remains.

3. **Card styling aligned with page**  
   Tiles now use the same card chrome as ModuleCard and other cards on the page:
   - Same border: `1px solid var(--p-border)`
   - Same radius: `var(--p-radius-lg)`
   - Same surface: `var(--p-surface)`
   - Same shadow: `var(--p-shadow-elev-1)`
   - Added 1px top accent line: `borderTop: '1px solid var(--p-accent-muted)'` to match ModuleCard (subtle, token-safe; no new visual system).

4. **Emphasis via content only**  
   Value text remains orange (`var(--p-accent)`). No harsh accent bars.

5. **Uniform structure**  
   All four tiles share the exact same `ResumeReadinessTile` component and classes; inner content wrapper is `p-3 flex flex-col gap-0.5` with no per-tile styling differences.

### Files changed

- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.tsx` — `ResumeReadinessTile`: removed gradient strip div and extra left padding; added `borderTop: '1px solid var(--p-accent-muted)'` to outer card; simplified inner wrapper to `p-3 flex flex-col gap-0.5`. Comment updated to describe alignment with ModuleCard/card system.

### Validation

- Visual: tiles are uniform and match other cards (same border, radius, surface, subtle top accent; value text orange).
- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed.
- **pnpm --filter @pathos/ui test --run** — Passed.

## Sidebar CAREER & JOBS order: Resume Builder before Resume Readiness (Mar 1, 2025)

### Task

Reorder sidebar navigation so “Resume Builder” appears before “Resume Readiness” under the CAREER & JOBS section. Desired order: … Job Search, Saved Jobs, Guided Apply, Resume Builder, Resume Readiness … (Application Confidence Center last).

### What changed

- **packages/ui/src/shell/Sidebar.tsx** — Reordered the `items` array in the CAREER & JOBS `navSections` entry. No route or label changes; only item order.
- New order: Job Search, Saved Jobs, Guided Apply, Resume Builder, Resume Readiness, Application Confidence Center.

### Constraints

- Routes and labels unchanged.
- Minimal diff (reorder only).
- Route parity unchanged.

### Validation

- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed.
- **pnpm -r test -- --run** — Passed.
- **pnpm routes:check** — OK; all Sidebar routes resolve in Desktop and Next.

## Dashboard Briefing tiles: match Resume Readiness tile style (Mar 1, 2025)

### Goal

Make the Dashboard “Briefing” row tiles (Saved Jobs, Tracked Apps, Readiness, Next Milestone) match the Resume Readiness tile style for visual consistency: remove orange accent bars / harsh accent borders, use the same neutral card styling, keep emphasis via content (value typography + delta/subtext).

### What changed

1. **Component identified**  
   The four tiles are rendered by `BriefingTile` in `packages/ui/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` (single shared component for all briefing tiles).

2. **Styles updated to match Resume Readiness tiles**  
   - **Removed:** 2px left accent strip (`borderLeft: '2px solid var(--p-accent-muted)'`) and extra left padding (`pl-[calc(0.75rem+2px)]`).  
   - **Added:** 1px top accent line on the outer card (`borderTop: '1px solid var(--p-accent-muted)'`) to match ModuleCard / Resume Readiness.  
   - **Unchanged:** Same border token (`var(--p-border)`), radius (`var(--p-radius-lg)`), surface (`var(--p-surface)`), shadow (`var(--p-shadow-elev-1)`). Inner content uses `p-3 flex flex-col gap-0.5` (no left padding).

3. **Signals preserved**  
   - Delta/subtext (e.g. “+1 this week”, “1 updated”) still rendered with `subtextPositive` for success color where used.  
   - Icons (BRIEFING_ICONS) unchanged.  
   - Label/value/subtext layout and padding unchanged.

4. **Tokens only**  
   All styling uses `var(--p-*)`; no hardcoded colors. No restyling of unrelated cards (FocusHeroCard, ModuleCard, etc. untouched).

### Files changed

- `packages/ui/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` — `BriefingTile`: removed left accent bar and extra padding; added `borderTop: '1px solid var(--p-accent-muted)'` to outer card; inner wrapper set to `p-3 flex flex-col gap-0.5`. Comment block updated to describe alignment with Resume Readiness tile style.

### Validation

- Visual: Dashboard briefing row tiles use same base card treatment as Resume Readiness (border, radius, surface, 1px top accent; no left strip).
- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed.
- **pnpm -r test -- --run** — Passed.

## Sidebar CAREER & JOBS: Guided Apply after Application Confidence Center (Mar 1, 2025)

### Task

Reorder sidebar nav under CAREER & JOBS so “Guided Apply” appears after “Application Confidence Center”. Target order: Job Search, Saved Jobs, Resume Builder, Resume Readiness, Application Confidence Center, Guided Apply.

### What changed

- **packages/ui/src/shell/Sidebar.tsx** — Reordered the `items` array in the CAREER & JOBS section: moved “Guided Apply” from third to last. Routes, labels, and icons unchanged; order only.

### Constraints

- Routes, labels, icons unchanged.
- Minimal diff (reorder only).
- Route parity unchanged.

### Validation

- **pnpm -r typecheck** — Passed.
- **pnpm -r test -- --run** — Passed.
- **pnpm routes:check** — OK; all Sidebar routes resolve in Desktop and Next.

## AI docs: Overlay Rule v1 and tooltip/overlay usage

**Goal:** Add Overlay Rule v1 and tooltip/overlay usage rules to AI docs so future Cursor runs don’t regress the overlay system.

### Doc sections added

- **docs/ai/cursor-house-rules.md:** New section “Overlay Rule v1 (Tooltips, Menus, Popovers)” — canonical Tooltip/DrawerTooltip wrappers; no inline `role="tooltip"` DOM; no Tailwind `z-*`; no `createPortal` in screens; run `pnpm overlays:check` in validation.
- **docs/ai/testing-standards.md:** New UI check “Overlay sanity” — hover tooltips near rail/drawer edges (confirm not clipped); open dropdown near rail (confirm above rail); confirm `pnpm overlays:check` passes.
- **docs/ai/prompt-header.md:** Added `pnpm overlays:check` to the required validation list for UI/overlay changes.

### Files changed

- `docs/ai/cursor-house-rules.md`
- `docs/ai/testing-standards.md`
- `docs/ai/prompt-header.md`
- `docs/merge-notes.md` (this log)

### Commands run

- `pnpm overlays:check` — passed (Overlay Rule v1 / OverlayRoot).

## Job Search screen v1 (Prompted Filters, store, PathAdvisor)

**Goal:** Build Job Search screen v1 to match mock: title/subtitle, Prompted Filters (translate to filters), search row, filters bar, results + details, PathAdvisor rail. Local-only; token-only styling; scroll invariant; route parity; no commits/pushes.

### Summary

- **Route + page:** Job Search route unchanged; screen shows title "Job Search" and subtitle "Explore roles, save targets, and reduce uncertainty." Web (Next) and desktop both use same route.
- **Stores:** New job search v1 Zustand store (`packages/ui/src/stores/jobSearchV1Store.ts`) with persistence to `pathos_job_search_v1`. State: lastQuery, filters, results (mock), selectedJobId, loading, hasSearched, appliedFromPrompt. Save job uses core `addSavedJobDirect` / `saveSavedJobsStore` so saved jobs appear in Saved Jobs screen.
- **Storage keys:** Added `JOB_SEARCH_V1_STORAGE_KEY` (`pathos_job_search_v1`) and `PROMPT_TO_FILTERS_AUDIT_KEY` (`pathos_jobsearch_prompt_to_filters_v1`) in `packages/core/src/storage-keys.ts` and `lib/storage-keys.ts`.
- **Prompted Filters:** Card with "Describe what you're looking for (optional)", placeholder, "Translate to filters" button. Deterministic parser (`packages/ui/src/lib/promptToFiltersParser.ts`) extracts GS levels, agencies (DHS, VA, etc.), remote/telework/hybrid, series, location phrase, keywords. Proposed filters preview with chips, interpretation line, Apply filters / Edit filters / Discard. On Apply: store filters, write audit to `pathos_jobsearch_prompt_to_filters_v1`, run search. "Applied from prompt" note with View (expand to show prompt).
- **Search row:** Keywords + optional location inputs, Search (primary), Reset (secondary), microcopy "Results shown from saved snapshots (mock) for now."
- **Filters bar:** Dropdowns All Grades, All Series, All Agencies, Any Location, All Types; Clear all filters; "Applied from prompt" + View.
- **Results + details:** Two panes (results list left, details center). Results: title, agency, location, close date, GS chip, fit badge (High/Medium/Low), Save per item, "New" / "Close date updated" on first two. Details: checklist sections (Specialized experience, Skills & keywords, Documents needed), Save job / Tailor resume / Ask PathAdvisor. States: before search "Run a search to view jobs.", loading skeleton, no results message.
- **PathAdvisor:** Screen overrides on mount (viewingLabel "Job Search", suggested prompts, briefingLabel "From Job Search"); Do now "Save and start tailoring" when job selected, cleared on unmount.
- **Tests:** Parser tests (`promptToFiltersParser.test.ts`), store tests (`jobSearchV1Store.test.ts`), screen tests (`JobSearchScreen.test.tsx` with NavigationProvider). Vitest already has localStorage polyfill and excludes **/node_modules/**.

### Files changed

- `lib/storage-keys.ts` — added JOB_SEARCH_V1_STORAGE_KEY, PROMPT_TO_FILTERS_AUDIT_KEY, STORAGE_KEYS entries.
- `packages/core/src/storage-keys.ts` — same keys.
- `packages/core/src/index.ts` — export new keys.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` — rewritten for v1 (title/subtitle, prompted filters, search row, filters bar, results + details, PathAdvisor overrides).
- `packages/ui/src/stores/jobSearchV1Store.ts` — new (Zustand store, persist pathos_job_search_v1, integrate core saved-jobs).
- `packages/ui/src/lib/promptToFiltersParser.ts` — new (deterministic prompt → filters + keywords + evidence).
- `packages/ui/src/screens/jobSearchMockChecklists.ts` — new (checklist data for mock jobs).
- `packages/ui/src/lib/promptToFiltersParser.test.ts` — new.
- `packages/ui/src/stores/jobSearchV1Store.test.ts` — new.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.test.tsx` — new.

### Validation commands (run and summarize)

- **pnpm -r typecheck** — PASS (all 4 scopes).
- **pnpm test** — PASS (700 tests, 46 files).
- **pnpm routes:check** — PASS (all Sidebar routes resolve in Desktop and Next).
- **pnpm overlays:check** — PASS (Overlay Rule v1 / OverlayRoot).

### Manual test checklist

- [ ] Job Search loads; scroll behaves (main scroll container only); PathAdvisor rail stays fixed.
- [ ] Prompt translate → proposed filters → Apply filters → chips reflect → search results update.
- [ ] Save job → appears in Saved Jobs (or saved state) → refresh → still saved.
- [ ] Clear filters and Reset behave predictably.
- [ ] Desktop and web both show the same route.

### Human Simulation Gate

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Required | Yes |
| Triggers hit | Adds Save/Apply action; changes store logic; persistence (pathos_job_search_v1, pathos_jobsearch_prompt_to_filters_v1, core saved-jobs). |
| Why | Create-button rule: save job → appears in Saved Jobs → refresh → still there; storage keys verified. |

### AI Acceptance Checklist

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Flow | Search → jobSearchV1Store.runSearch() → results; Save job → core addSavedJobDirect/saveSavedJobsStore → Saved Jobs screen; Apply from prompt → store filters + audit key pathos_jobsearch_prompt_to_filters_v1. |
| Store(s) | useJobSearchV1Store (packages/ui); core loadSavedJobsStore/saveSavedJobsStore for saved jobs. |
| Storage key(s) | pathos_job_search_v1, pathos_jobsearch_prompt_to_filters_v1, pathos:saved-jobs-store (core). |
| Failure mode | Broken store: results/saved state lost on refresh. Broken save: job not in Saved Jobs. |
| How tested | Unit: parser, store (runSearch, applyProposedFiltersFromPrompt, saveJob), screen (title/subtitle). Manual: create → appears elsewhere → refresh → still there. |

## Job Search evaluation path (mock data, sample jobs, PathAdvisor copy)

**Goal:** One-click evaluation: mock jobs dataset, "Load sample jobs" button, "Use example prompt" link, prompt-to-filters runs mockSearchJobs; PathAdvisor rail Job Search helper copy (no compensation). Minimal diffs; token-only; scroll invariant; overlay rule unchanged.

### What changed

- **A) Mock jobs:** New `packages/ui/src/screens/jobSearchMockJobs.ts`: `MOCK_JOBS` (10 items, stable ids mock-js-1..mock-js-10), `MOCK_JOB_TAGS` (New / Close date updated for mock-js-1, mock-js-2), variety (agencies, grades, Remote/DC/Arlington). `mockSearchJobs(input, jobs)` pure function: keywords (title/summary), location substring, filters (gradeBand, agency, series, location, remoteType, appointmentType), sort by close-date order.
- **B) Store:** `jobSearchV1Store` uses `MOCK_JOBS` and `mockSearchJobs` for `runSearch()`. New action `loadSampleJobs()`: sets results = MOCK_JOBS, hasSearched = true, selectedJobId = first id.
- **C) Empty state:** "Run a search to view jobs." kept; added "Load sample jobs" button (calls `loadSampleJobs()`, details pane shows first job). "Use example prompt" link fills prompt input with placeholder text so "Translate to filters" becomes enabled.
- **D) Prompt-to-filters:** Empty prompt keeps "Translate to filters" disabled. After "Use example prompt", Apply filters applies filters and runs search via `mockSearchJobs`.
- **E) PathAdvisor:** `PathAdvisorScreenOverrides` extended with optional `helperParagraph`. Job Search sets `helperParagraph` to "Use this workspace to decode job requirements and decide your next best move. Ask about specialized experience, keywords, and what to do next." PathAdvisorCard uses it when message list empty (no compensation copy on Job Search).
- **F) Checklists:** `jobSearchMockChecklists` maps mock-js-* ids to existing checklist keys so details pane shows SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE / SKILLS / DOCUMENTS. List item tags from `MOCK_JOB_TAGS` (not index).
- **Tests:** `jobSearchMockJobs.test.ts` (mockSearchJobs filters agency/grade/keywords/location, sort); `jobSearchV1Store.test.ts` (loadSampleJobs populates and selects first); `jobSearchMockChecklists.test.ts` (getChecklistForJob mock-js-1 returns checklist); `JobSearchScreen.test.tsx` (after loadSampleJobs store has results and first job selected).
