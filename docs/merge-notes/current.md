### Files changed this run

- `packages/ui/src/screens/ResumeBuilderScreen.tsx` — Resume slice container, edit-ready mode state, section formatting improvements, edit toggle in control row
- `packages/ui/src/screens/ResumeBuilderScreen.test.tsx` — 32 new tests for edit-ready mode, resume slice container, section formatting, SSR regression
- `docs/change-briefs/resume-builder-resume-slice.md` — Non-technical change brief
- `docs/merge-notes/current.md` — This file

### Behavior changes

- **Resume slice container:** Focused section content now renders inside a document-like panel (`resume-slice-container` testid) with border, shadow, and surface background. Reduces "floating content" visual problem.
- **Edit-ready mode toggle:** New `section-edit-toggle` button in the control row toggles between View mode (clean, resume-like) and Edit-ready mode (editable areas highlighted, inline actions visible). Uses `aria-pressed` for accessibility.
- **View mode:** Bullet health indicators hidden, inline actions hidden, bullet text not clickable, pencil icons hidden, add-bullet buttons hidden. Section reads like a polished resume.
- **Edit-ready mode:** Health dots/badges visible, inline actions for all bullets, click-to-edit enabled, pencil icons visible, add-bullet buttons visible. Accent-tinted editable highlights on all sections.
- **ContactHeader:** Name in uppercase with wider tracking, pipe-separated contact details (no emojis), citizenship/veteran status on federal-specific line.
- **EducationSection:** Resume-style formatting with degree/institution/dates rhythm, heading with bottom border.
- **SkillsSection:** View mode shows comma-separated dense list; edit-ready mode shows interactive chips.
- **FederalDetailsSection:** Two-column data grid with labeled fields, consistent heading.
- **CertificationsSection:** Structured list with consistent heading and edit-ready highlighting.
- **SupportingEvidenceSection:** Framed placeholder with consistent heading.
- **ExperienceBlock:** Stronger title/employer/dates hierarchy, entries separated by borders, pencil icon and add-bullet only in edit-ready mode.
- **BulletRow:** Health indicators and inline actions gated behind edit-ready mode.

### Tests

- 140 tests total (32 new, 108 existing)
- All pass
- TypeScript compiles cleanly

### Patch artifacts

```
artifacts/resume-builder-resume-slice.patch         — 216,696 bytes (cumulative: origin/develop to working tree)
artifacts/resume-builder-resume-slice-this-run.patch — 189,831 bytes (incremental: HEAD to working tree)
```

### Known risks and follow-ups

- Edit-ready mode is currently a boolean toggle. Future work could auto-activate edit-ready when the user starts typing or clicks into an editable area.
- ProfessionalSummaryBlock in view mode does not allow click-to-edit. Users must toggle to edit-ready mode first. This is intentional but may need user feedback.
- Federal Details, Certifications, and Supporting Evidence sections use mock data. Real editing flows deferred to later phases.
- No human simulation gate triggered — changes are primarily visual/structural with state behavior validated by tests.

### What changed this run

#### ResumeBuilderScreen.tsx
- **Added `identity-summary` to SectionId type** — new combined editing group
- **Added `EDIT_SECTION_GROUPS`** — 7 top-level Edit tab section definitions (identity-summary replaces separate contact/summary)
- **Added `EDIT_SECTION_META`** — section metadata for Edit dashboard using grouped sections with composite scores
- **Made local Edit control row persistent** — renders in both dashboard and focused states with `data-testid="edit-local-control-row"`
- **Dashboard icon button** — accent-highlighted when on dashboard, muted when in focused mode
- **Section dropdown adapts to state** — shows "Overview" on dashboard, active section name on focused
- **Added SectionDropdownMenu component** — extracted dropdown with Overview option, per-item hover tracking, focus-visible rings
- **Added SectionDropdownItem component** — individual item with explicit useState hover tracking, layered background logic
- **Redesigned SectionDashboard** — added compact summary strip (Match/Readiness/blocker/fastest win), priority-sorted section cards
- **Merged Contact + Summary in focused editor** — `identity-summary` renders both ContactHeader and ProfessionalSummaryBlock with separator
- **Updated cross-tab jump handlers** — `handleJumpToSection` and `handleEditSection` map contact/summary to identity-summary
- **Added Home, LayoutGrid imports** from lucide-react

#### ResumeBuilderScreen.test.tsx
- **Added "Edit impact — identity-summary grouping"** — validates EDIT_SECTION_META grouping, composite score, individual preservation
- **Added "Edit impact — persistent local control row"** — test ID, handler contract, dropdown label states
- **Added "Edit impact — dashboard summary strip data model"** — validates all four summary strip data dependencies, priority sort
- **Added "Edit impact — section dropdown structure"** — Overview option, EDIT_SECTION_META coverage, status derivation, combined editor
- **Added "Edit impact — cross-tab jump mapping"** — contact/summary to identity-summary mapping logic
- **Added "Edit impact — SSR structural regression"** — loading state, focused-editor-header removal check
- **Updated EXPECTED_SECTION_IDS** — added identity-summary to expected list (9 entries)
- **Updated focused-editor target test** — now checks both MOCK_SECTION_META and EDIT_SECTION_META
- **Updated focused-editor header test IDs** — references edit-local-control-row instead of focused-editor-header
- Total: 16 new tests (112 total, all passing)

### Behavior changes
- Edit tab now has a persistent local control row visible in both dashboard and focused states
- Dashboard icon button is accent-highlighted when on dashboard, muted in focused mode
- Section dropdown shows "Overview" on dashboard, active section name on focused
- Dropdown includes "Overview" option at top to return to dashboard
- Dropdown items have per-item hover tracking with visible background shifts
- Contact Information and Professional Summary are now one editing group: "Identity & Summary"
- Edit dashboard shows 7 section cards instead of 8
- Dashboard has a compact summary strip with Match, Readiness, biggest blocker, fastest win
- Section cards are sorted by priority (weakest/most-issues first)
- Cross-tab jumps from Coverage Map/Suggested Changes map contact/summary to identity-summary

### Tests
- 112 tests passing (96 prior + 16 new)
- TypeScript: clean (tsc --noEmit)
- Lints: clean

### Patch artifacts
- `artifacts/resume-builder-edit-impact.patch` — cumulative diff (origin/develop to HEAD, committed) — 52.8 KB
- `artifacts/resume-builder-edit-impact-this-run.patch` — incremental diff (working tree only) — 123.2 KB

### Known risks and follow-ups
- LiveScoreAnchor, SectionEditorHeader, IntelligenceStrip, SectionOrganizer, SectionOrganizerItem are dead code — cleanup pass needed
- MOCK_SECTION_META still static — future phase should compute from live draft
- EDIT_SECTION_META identity-summary composite score is hardcoded (50%) — should be computed
- Dropdown lacks arrow-key listbox navigation (keyboard users can tab through options)
- Section card priority sort is by completion/issues only — could factor in relevance

### Human simulation gate
- Required: Yes — structural grouping change, new persistent control, new dashboard layout
- Triggers: merged editing group, persistent control row, priority-sorted dashboard, summary strip
- Evidence: typecheck clean, 112 tests pass, linter clean

### What changed this run

#### ResumeBuilderScreen.tsx
- **Refined TabBar** — grouped segmented-control treatment with stronger hit areas (px-4 py-2.5), explicit hover tracking with underline-hint pattern, accent bg tint on active tab
- **Added WorkspaceModeTabButton** — individual tab button sub-component with useState hover tracking per mode-switch interaction-state standard
- **Added overall score module to tab row** — Match + Readiness chips at far-right end of TabBar, replaces separate status strip
- **Removed LiveScoreAnchor from Edit tab body** — no longer rendered inside Edit's main content; scores now in tab row
- **Replaced focused-editor breadcrumb header** — old "Back to sections / Section Name" breadcrumb replaced with compact control row: home icon (LayoutGrid) + section dropdown + section score
- **Added section dropdown** — custom dropdown listing all 8 sections with icons and status badges, allows direct section switching
- **Added section score display** — compact completion% + status label at far-right of focused-editor header
- **Added showSectionDropdown state** — open/close state with outside-click-to-close effect
- **Added Home, LayoutGrid imports** from lucide-react

#### ResumeBuilderScreen.test.tsx
- **Added "Header cleanup — overall score module data model"** — validates score derivation and overall vs section score distinction
- **Added "Header cleanup — section dropdown data model"** — validates all sections present, status derivation, test ID naming, no draft mutation on switch
- **Added "Header cleanup — focused-editor control structure"** — validates test ID conventions, score source distinction
- **Added "Header cleanup — SSR structural regression"** — validates loading state, LiveScoreAnchor removal, workspace tabs presence
- Total: 11 new tests (96 total, all passing)

### Behavior changes
- Tab row now uses grouped/segmented treatment with explicit hover states
- Overall Match + Readiness scores now visible at far-right of tab row (all tabs)
- LiveScoreAnchor strip no longer rendered in Edit tab body
- Focused-editor header uses home icon + section dropdown + section score instead of breadcrumb text
- Section dropdown allows direct switching without returning to dashboard
- Section score shows completionPct + status label for current section

### Tests
- 96 tests passing (85 prior + 11 new)
- TypeScript: clean (tsc --noEmit)
- Lints: clean

### Patch artifacts
- `artifacts/resume-builder-header-cleanup.patch` — cumulative diff (origin/develop to HEAD, committed) — 52.8 KB
- `artifacts/resume-builder-header-cleanup-this-run.patch` — incremental diff (working tree only) — 85.3 KB

### Known risks and follow-ups
- LiveScoreAnchor component still exists in file (dead code) — can be removed in cleanup pass
- SectionEditorHeader component no longer used in focused-editor header — retained for possible reuse but is dead code
- IntelligenceStrip shim still exists — dead code from earlier phase
- MOCK_SECTION_META is still static — future phase should compute from live draft
- Section dropdown closes on outside click but doesn't trap focus (keyboard-only navigation works via tab but no arrow-key listbox behavior)

### Human simulation gate
- Required: Yes — UI control structure changes to primary workspace header
- Triggers: new tab bar treatment, new overall score placement, new section control pattern
- Evidence: typecheck clean, 96 tests pass, linter clean

```

### What changed this run

#### ResumeBuilderScreen.tsx
- **Removed ContextStrip** from render — "You are editing: Master Resume" bar eliminated
- **Removed SectionOrganizer** from Edit layout — left sidebar rail removed
- **Added SectionDashboard** — new default landing state with section cards grid
- **Added SectionDashboardCard** — individual clickable work-module cards with status badges
- **Added LiveScoreAnchor** — compact persistent Match + Readiness score module
- **Added editMode state** — 'dashboard' | 'focused' controlling two-state Edit tab
- **Added deriveSectionStatus / deriveSectionMetric** — status label derivation from metadata
- **Added handleBackToDashboard** — handler for returning to section dashboard
- **Refactored SectionEditorHeader** — now an inline flex element within breadcrumb row
- **Updated cross-tab jump handlers** — handleJumpToSection, handleEditSection, handleProposalEditFirst now set editMode='focused'
- **Added "Back to sections" button** — breadcrumb-style navigation in focused editor

#### ResumeBuilderScreen.test.tsx
- **Added deriveSectionStatus tests** — validates all status labels (Strong/Moderate/Missing/Needs Work/Critical)
- **Added deriveSectionMetric tests** — validates compact metric strings
- **Added Edit Dashboard structure tests** — card test IDs, state transition contracts
- **Added SSR regression test** — verifies ContextStrip removal and loading state
- **Updated imports** — added deriveSectionStatus, deriveSectionMetric, SectionStatusInfo, EditMode

### Behavior changes
- Edit tab now defaults to section dashboard (card grid) instead of immediately showing a section editor
- Clicking a dashboard card opens focused editor for that section
- "Back to sections" button returns to dashboard
- ContextStrip no longer visible
- Left section organizer no longer visible
- Compact LiveScoreAnchor replaces both removed strips

### Tests
- 85 tests passing (all prior + 23 new)
- TypeScript: clean (tsc --noEmit)
- Lints: clean

### Patch artifacts
- `artifacts/resume-builder-edit-dashboard.patch` — cumulative diff (origin/develop to working tree) — 90.9 KB
- `artifacts/resume-builder-edit-dashboard-this-run.patch` — incremental diff (working tree only) — 59.4 KB

### Known risks and follow-ups
- SectionOrganizer and ContextStrip components still exist in the file (dead code) — can be removed in a cleanup pass
- MOCK_SECTION_META is still static — a future phase should compute section metadata from live draft state
- LiveScoreAnchor shows "Biggest blocker" but not "Fastest win" — could add a toggle or alternate
- Preview / Version Diff tabs remain scaffolded placeholders

### Human simulation gate
- Required: Yes — UI structural changes to the primary editing surface
- Triggers: new default state, removed components, new navigation pattern
- Evidence: typecheck clean, 85 tests pass, linter clean

```

## What changed

### ResumeBuilderScreen.tsx
- **SectionsRail → SectionOrganizer + SectionOrganizerItem**: Redesigned left panel from nav-like sidebar to card-based section organizer. Each section is a distinct work-unit card with completion bar, issue badge, relevance indicator, and "Editing" badge for the active section.
- **SectionOrganizerItem**: New component with explicit useState hover tracking per Interaction-State Standard. Hover: surface2 bg + border brightening. Selected: accent-tinted bg + 4px accent left border + "Editing" badge. Focus-visible: 2px inset ring via Tailwind + --p-accent.
- **SectionEditorHeader**: New component shown at top of center editing surface. Identifies the active section with icon, label, and metadata (completion %, issues, relevance).
- **Section-focused Edit tab**: Center editing surface now renders only the selected section instead of the full resume stacked vertically. Each section guarded by `activeSection === 'sectionId'` conditional.
- **activeSectionMeta**: New useMemo deriving the active section's metadata from MOCK_SECTION_META for the section editor header.
- **Simplified handlers**: handleSectionClick, handleJumpToSection, handleEditSection no longer use scrollIntoView. handleProposalEditFirst removed setTimeout scroll delay.
- **New exports**: SECTION_DEFS, MOCK_SECTION_META, SectionMeta exported for test validation.
- **New data-testid markers**: `section-editor-header`, `edit-section-{sectionId}`, `data-selected`, `data-hovered` on organizer items.

### ResumeBuilderScreen.test.tsx
- Added 4 new test suites (16 tests total) for section-focused Edit model:
  - Section definitions: covers all IDs, labels, icons
  - Section metadata: covers all IDs, valid ranges, label matching
  - Data integrity: no cross-section mutation, stable coverage dimensions, deterministic test IDs
  - SSR structural regression: loading state and tab structure intact

## Validation performed

- `pnpm typecheck` — clean
- `pnpm test -- --run` — 887 tests pass across 58 files
- `pnpm test -- --run packages/ui/src/screens/ResumeBuilderScreen.test.tsx` — 61 tests pass (45 existing + 16 new)
- Lint check on modified file — no errors

## Patch artifacts

| Artifact | Size |
|----------|------|
| `artifacts/resume-builder-edit-focus.patch` | 45,327 bytes |
| `artifacts/resume-builder-edit-focus-this-run.patch` | 45,327 bytes |

## Change brief

Updated: `docs/change-briefs/resume-builder-edit-focus.md`

## Human simulation gate

Not required for this run — changes are structural UI refinements testable by visual inspection. Section-focused model is validated by unit tests. Interaction states (hover, selected, focus-visible) use standard patterns documented in the Interaction-State Standard.

## Known risks and follow-ups

- Section organizer `MOCK_SECTION_META` is static — future work should compute metadata from draft content + target job analysis
- Focus-visible ring uses `--tw-ring-color` CSS custom property via TypeScript cast — works but relies on Tailwind JIT
- Scroll position per section is not preserved when switching sections (optional improvement noted in task)
- Contact section has limited editing capability (display only) — future work to add inline contact editing

# Resume Builder Phase 2 — Suggested Changes + Coverage Map (March 25, 2026)

**Branch:** `feature/backend-usajobs-ingestion-v1`
**Scope:** Resume Builder Phase 2 — Suggested Changes, Coverage Map, target-job hardening, PathAdvisor tab-awareness. No commit/push.

## What changed

Phase 2 extension of the Resume Builder workspace. Replaced placeholder tabs with real implementations:

### Suggested Changes tab — broader proposal review surface
- Summary header showing pending count, avg confidence, strongest category
- Proposals grouped by resume section (Summary, Work Experience, Federal Details, Skills)
- Each proposal card: title, confidence badge, needs-confirmation state, before/after content, reason, supported requirement cue
- Accept applies the proposal to the active resume (summary text, duty line replacement)
- Dismiss removes from queue without mutation
- Edit First switches to Edit tab with suggested content loaded into editing state
- Empty state when all proposals are reviewed

### Coverage Map tab — actionable diagnostic surface
- Overall coverage score (average of 5 dimensions), high-priority gap count, weakest dimension callout
- 5 diagnostic dimensions: Specialized Experience, Resume Evidence, Keywords Coverage, Leadership/Scope, Federal Details
- Each dimension: score bar (color-coded), severity badge, status summary, linked section, action affordances
- Action buttons: Review proposals, Jump to section, Edit section
- Resume Evidence dimension responds to summary presence (score improves when filled)
- Zero-state when no target job selected

### Data/logic model
- `ResumeProposal` interface with id, type, title, sectionKey, confidence, reason, supportedRequirement, beforeText, suggestedText, needsConfirmation, status
- `CoverageDimension` interface with id, label, scorePct, severity, statusSummary, linkedSection, suggestionCount, actionHint
- `generateProposals()` — deterministic local logic driven by draft content + target job
- `generateCoverageDimensions()` — deterministic local logic with slight draft responsiveness
- All exported for unit testing

### Target-job change hardening
- Switching target jobs now explicitly regenerates proposals (all pending) and recalculates coverage dimensions
- Intelligence strip values (match score, readiness, top gap) are now computed from coverage dimensions, not hardcoded
- Resume text is never auto-mutated by target job changes

### PathAdvisor tab-awareness
- Edit tab: emphasizes weakest bullet and rewrite suggestion
- Suggested Changes tab: emphasizes proposal review and highest-confidence proposal
- Coverage Map tab: emphasizes biggest gap and which section to fix first

### Phase 1 hardening
- Removed static badge:8 from WORKSPACE_TABS — badge count now driven by live proposal state
- Fixed version count pluralization (1 version vs N versions)
- Replaced hardcoded mockMatchScore/mockReadinessScore/mockTopGap/mockProposalCount with computed values
- Preview and Version Diff tabs now show "coming soon" messaging

## Files changed this run
- `packages/ui/src/screens/ResumeBuilderScreen.tsx` (M) — Phase 2 implementation (~1400 lines added)
- `packages/ui/src/screens/ResumeBuilderScreen.test.tsx` (M) — Phase 2 tests (31 total, 17 new)
- `docs/change-briefs/resume-builder-phase2.md` (A) — non-technical change brief
- `docs/merge-notes/current.md` (M) — this file

## Validation performed
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — exit 0 (clean)
- `npx vitest run packages/ui/src/screens/ResumeBuilderScreen.test.tsx` — 31 tests passed, exit 0
- Linter: clean (no errors in modified files)

## Git state
- `git branch --show-current`: `feature/backend-usajobs-ingestion-v1`
- `git status --short`: 2 modified (merge-notes, ResumeBuilderScreen.tsx), 2 untracked (ResumeBuilderScreen.test.tsx, change-briefs/resume-builder-phase2.md)
- `git diff --name-status develop...HEAD`: empty (no commits on branch)
- `git diff --stat`: 2 files, ~3757 insertions, ~538 deletions
- No commits made. No push.

## Patch artifacts
- `artifacts/resume-builder-phase2.patch` — cumulative working-tree diff (177.6 KB)
- `artifacts/resume-builder-phase2-this-run.patch` — incremental diff for this run (177.6 KB)

## Known risks / follow-ups
- Federal Details and Keywords proposals accept conceptually but do not yet auto-apply to the underlying data model (Phase 2 boundary)
- Coverage dimension scores are deterministic mocks; a real analysis engine will replace them
- Preview and Version Diff tabs remain scaffolded placeholders
- No Playwright/browser-level tests added; SSR + unit tests cover the regression seams
- Human simulation gate: not formally required (no routing/persistence/hydration changes), but recommended before merge

# Resume Builder Phase 1 — Workspace implementation (March 25, 2026)

**Branch:** `feature/backend-foundation-hardening-v1`  
**Scope:** Resume Builder Phase 1 workspace implementation. No commit/push.

## What changed

Complete rewrite of `ResumeBuilderScreen.tsx` from a simple two-pane form editor into a full workspace with:
- Top workspace bar with target job selector, autonomy mode, version count, export, Tailor to Job
- Context strip showing editing state and mode
- Left sections rail with completion bars, issue counts, relevance indicators
- Tabbed center panel (Edit active; Suggested Changes, Coverage Map, Preview, Version Diff scaffolded)
- Intelligence strip with match/readiness scores against target job
- Structured federal resume canvas with document-like editing
- Work experience with individual bullet health states and inline actions
- Inline suggested rewrite card with Accept / Edit First / Dismiss
- Professional summary missing state with trust-first messaging
- PathAdvisor route-aware overrides (insights, prompts, next best action)

New test file `ResumeBuilderScreen.test.tsx` with 14 passing tests.

## Files changed

- `packages/ui/src/screens/ResumeBuilderScreen.tsx` — complete rewrite (671 → ~1650 lines)
- `packages/ui/src/screens/ResumeBuilderScreen.test.tsx` — new test file (14 tests)
- `docs/change-briefs/resume-builder-phase1.md` — new change brief
- `docs/merge-notes/current.md` — updated

## Patch artifacts

- `artifacts/resume-builder-phase1.patch` — cumulative (committed changes vs main)
- `artifacts/resume-builder-phase1-this-run.patch` — incremental (working tree changes, ~120KB)

## Validation

- `vitest run ResumeBuilderScreen.test.tsx` — 14/14 pass
- `vitest run SavedJobsScreen.test.tsx` — 10/10 pass (no regression)
- `tsc --noEmit --project packages/ui/tsconfig.json` — pass (0 errors)

## Risks / follow-ups

- Bullet health states are hardcoded in mock data; future deterministic engine will compute them.
- Match/readiness scores are mock values; wiring to real analysis engine is a Phase 2 concern.
- Federal Details and Certifications sections show mock data, not yet editable.
- Tab content for non-Edit tabs is placeholder; each tab needs Phase 2+ implementation.
- No browser runtime validation was performed in this run.

# Day 10 run 1774129401635 — PathAdvisor canonical workspace hardening (March 21, 2026)

**Branch:** `feature/pathadvisor-canonical-workspace-clean-rerun`  
**Scope:** Approved PathAdvisor canonical workspace hardening only. No commit/push.

## What changed

- Removed the duplicate PathAdvisor header trash control from the shared card path and kept clear-context access in settings.
- Fixed the Job Search rail override to use `briefingHelperText`, which is the field consumed by the shared card, so the helper copy now renders in the canonical Guidance view.
- Tightened the shared `PathAdvisorCard` regression to assert a single trash control without using `??` in modified test code.

## Files changed

- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx`

## Validation

- `pnpm exec vitest run packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorCard.test.tsx` — pass
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — pass

## Risks / follow-ups

- `Explain` and `Actions` tabs still render placeholder content; unchanged in this hardening pass.
- No browser runtime pass was run in this step, so the approved visual state was preserved by code inspection and targeted tests only.

# Day 74 — Job Search Parity with Saved Jobs v1 (March 15, 2026)

**Branch:** `feature/day-74-job-search-parity-with-saved-jobs-v1`
**Scope:** Job Search screen only — structural parity with Saved Jobs. No commit/push.

## Required workflow logging

- **git status:** branch `feature/day-74-job-search-parity-with-saved-jobs-v1`, clean before edits; 2 files modified after edits
- **git branch --show-current:** `feature/day-74-job-search-parity-with-saved-jobs-v1`
- **git diff --name-status develop...HEAD:** empty (all changes are uncommitted working-tree modifications)
- **git diff --stat develop...HEAD:** empty (same reason — no commits on this branch yet)

## What changed

- **JobSearchScreen.tsx:** Restructured the selected-job detail panel to match Saved Jobs' fixed-zone architecture:
  - FIXED ZONE 1: Job header with title, agency, large color-coded readiness badge, match score badge
  - FIXED ZONE 2: Professional mode tabs (Match Overview / Job Details) with hover/active/selected states
  - FIXED ZONE 3: Professional sub-tabs (Overview & Docs / Requirements / PathOS Brief) in listing mode
  - Scrollable content viewport (only this zone scrolls)
  - FIXED ZONE 4: Structurally fixed action bar (Save, Build Resume, Ask PathAdvisor, View on USAJOBS)
  - Trust footer
- **Decision Summary Band:** Job info tiles (Agency, Grade & Promotion, Salary, Work Mode, Deadline) + secondary metadata row
- **Per-job readiness derivation:** `deriveJobReadiness()` produces varied scores per job exercising green/amber/red tiers
- **List item readiness pills:** Each row shows a color-coded readiness percentage badge (matching Saved Jobs)
- **List item selection:** Accent-tinted background matching Saved Jobs row selection
- **Search input focus:** Added focus-visible ring with transition to both search inputs
- **New tab components:** `JobSearchModeTab` and `JobSearchSubTab` with explicit hover/active/selected state management
- **JobSearchScreen.test.tsx:** 12 new Day 74 tests covering structural parity, mode tabs, readiness badges, action bar, decision summary band, search controls preservation

## Files changed

1. `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` — major restructure (+1105 −415)
2. `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.test.tsx` — 12 new tests (+94)

## Preserved as Job Search-specific

- Live search/discovery behavior (Search, Reset, filter dropdowns, sort)
- Describe → Translate to Filters panel
- Quick preview behavior (info icon on list rows)
- Save/unsave toggle per job
- Match intelligence (readiness + match scores, match breakdown, dimension briefings)
- Open Career Readiness action
- Explain this match → PathAdvisor
- Applied from prompt indicator with View/Undo
- Filter guide drawers (series, agency, location)
- Target role modal
- Load more pagination

## Validation

- 44 vitest tests pass (12 new + 32 existing)
- 10 Saved Jobs tests pass (no regressions)
- Linter: 0 errors
- No commit, no push

- **Incremental:** `artifacts/day-74-this-run.patch` — 84,106 bytes (82.1 KB)
- **Note:** Both patches are equivalent because all branch changes are uncommitted.

# Day 73 run 10 — Tab label rename on Saved Jobs workspace (March 15, 2026)

**Branch:** `savedJobsPage`
**Scope:** Saved Jobs page only — tab label rename. No layout, behavior, routing, or architecture changes. No commit/push.

## What changed

- Renamed "Decision View" tab to "Match Overview"
- Renamed "Announcement" tab to "Job Overview"
- Updated aria-labels, comments, and test expectations to match
- No changes to interaction states, styling, layout, or architecture

## Required workflow logging

- **git status:** branch `savedJobsPage` with pre-existing Day 73 working-tree changes plus this label rename; no staged changes
- **git branch --show-current:** `savedJobsPage`
- **git diff --name-status develop...HEAD:** empty (all changes are uncommitted working-tree modifications)
- **git diff --stat develop...HEAD:** empty (same reason)
- **Baseline note:** `develop` exists, but `develop...HEAD` is empty because all Day 73 work remains in the working tree rather than in branch commits.

## Patch artifacts

- **Cumulative:** `artifacts/day-73.patch` — generated from `git diff develop -- . ':!artifacts/'`; 334,312 bytes (326.5 KB)
- **Incremental:** `artifacts/day-73-this-run.patch` — generated from `git diff -- ':!artifacts/'`; 334,312 bytes (326.5 KB)

# Day 73 run 9 — Saved Jobs hardening review pass (March 15, 2026)

**Branch:** `savedJobsPage`  
**Scope:** Saved Jobs only. No Job Search implementation changes. No commit/push.

## Required workflow logging

- **git status:** branch contains pre-existing Day 73 working-tree changes plus this hardening pass; new Saved Jobs files remain unstaged.
- **git branch --show-current:** `savedJobsPage`
- **git diff --name-status develop...HEAD:** no output in this checkout
- **git diff --stat develop...HEAD:** no output in this checkout
- **Baseline note:** `develop` exists, but `develop...HEAD` is empty here because the current Day 73 work is still in the working tree rather than in branch commits.

## Patch artifacts

- **Cumulative:** `artifacts/day-73.patch` — generated from `git diff develop...HEAD`; currently `0` bytes because the commit-range diff is empty in this checkout.
- **Incremental:** `artifacts/day-73-this-run.patch` — generated from `git diff`; currently `322147` bytes.
- **Artifact size log (`ls artifacts/day-73.patch,artifacts/day-73-this-run.patch`):**
  - `artifacts/day-73.patch` — `0`
  - `artifacts/day-73-this-run.patch` — `322147`

## Hardening summary

- **Accessibility:** added proper tab/panel semantics to Decision View and Announcement navigation (`aria-controls`, stable ids, selected tab focus handling).
- **Interaction states:** added `focus-within` treatment on saved-job rows so keyboard navigation now has a visible row-level state instead of only an inner text ring.
- **Score correctness:** fixed the header match badge so its color follows the shared score-tier rules instead of always rendering as success green.
- **Layout stability:** kept the fixed footer pattern, added explicit test hooks for the scroll region and action row, and made the decision-summary grids auto-fit instead of forcing cramped four-column layouts at narrower widths.
- **Decision hierarchy:** retained the decision-first strip, but hardened it as the clear first-glance layer above Match Intelligence; low-value `Schedule` remains out of the prime decision band.
- **Build Resume:** verified and preserved as a first-class fixed action; added regression coverage for its presence.
- **Mock data:** widened the deterministic score spread and added exact threshold examples so red / amber / green bands can all be reviewed, including `60` and `80` readiness boundaries.
- **Tests:** replaced the prior smoke-only Saved Jobs test file with focused regressions for action-row presence, Build Resume, tab/panel semantics, mode-specific rendering, score-tier behavior, and deterministic mock-data coverage.

## Files changed in this pass

- `packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.tsx`
- `packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.test.tsx`
- `packages/core/src/saved-jobs-mock-data.ts`
- `docs/change-briefs/day-73.md`
- `docs/merge-notes/current.md`
- `artifacts/codexReview.md`
- `artifacts/day-73.patch`
- `artifacts/day-73-this-run.patch`

## Validation

- `pnpm lint` — pass with pre-existing repo warnings; no lint errors after this pass
- `pnpm typecheck` — pass
- `pnpm test` — pass (`57` files, `814` tests)
- `pnpm build` — pass
- `pnpm test packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.test.tsx` — pass (`10` tests)

## Known risks / follow-ups

- **Branch hygiene:** `git status` still shows many Day 73 branch-wide working-tree changes outside the three Saved Jobs files touched in this pass; reviewers should evaluate this run within that broader branch context.
- **Runtime feel still needs human eyes:** the new semantics and layout stability are validated structurally, but the hover/active feel of the tabs still deserves a quick manual pass in `/dashboard/saved-jobs`.
- **Existing repo warnings remain:** lint warnings and noisy test stderr from unrelated areas remain outside this task’s scope.
- **Unused helpers remain in the screen file:** `buildAnchorKey` and `countUniqueAgencies` are still unused pre-existing leftovers; not changed here to avoid scope creep.

# Day 73 run 8 — Saved Jobs visual parity correction (March 14, 2026)

**Branch:** `savedJobsPage`  
**Scope:** Saved Jobs page only; Job Search as live visual/theme baseline; approved mockup as structure/composition target. No commit/push.

## Required workflow logging

- **git status:** On branch savedJobsPage; changes not staged (SavedJobsScreen.tsx, docs, etc.).
- **git branch --show-current:** savedJobsPage.
- **git diff --stat:** 20 files changed, 2524 insertions(+), 918 deletions(-).

## Patch artifacts

- **Cumulative:** `artifacts/day-73.patch` (git diff; 180KB).
- **Incremental (this run):** `artifacts/day-73-this-run.patch` (git diff -- SavedJobsScreen.tsx; 67KB).

## Summary (run 8 — visual parity correction)

Used Job Search as the live visual/theme baseline and the approved Saved Jobs mockup as the structure/composition target.

### Theme corrections (Saved Jobs → Job Search parity)
- **Header:** Reduced from text-2xl font-bold px-6 to text-xl font-semibold px-4 pt-4 pb-2 (matches Job Search).
- **Subtitle:** Changed from --p-text-dim to --p-text-muted (matches Job Search).
- **Removed** decorative Bookmark icon from header title.
- **Selected card:** Replaced 4px accent left border + surface2 always-bg with Job Search pattern — transparent bg for unselected, surface2 for selected; 2px left accent bar on selected (like Job Search match bar).
- **Card hover:** Added explicit onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave hover tracking with surface2 bg (like Job Search), replacing opacity-based hover.
- **Card layout:** Consolidated agency+location into one "Agency • Location" line (like Job Search); reduced padding from px-4 py-3.5 to pl-[calc(0.75rem+2px)] pr-3 py-2.
- **Chips:** All chips now use surface2/text-dim (same as Job Search); close-date-soon chips use accent-bg/accent (same as Job Search urgent chips).
- **Detail action bar:** Made sticky at bottom with border-t and var(--p-surface) bg (same pattern as Job Search action bar).
- **Guided Apply button:** Changed from custom font-semibold px-4 py-3 rounded-lg to INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS with standard px-4 py-2 text-sm rounded (Job Search button family).
- **Remove from Saved button:** Changed from solid danger fill to outlined danger (transparent bg, danger border+text) — Job Search has no solid danger buttons.
- **Open Official Listing:** Changed from accent border to standard var(--p-border) (matches Job Search secondary button pattern).
- **AskPathAdvisorButton:** Removed accentBorder prop so it uses default var(--p-border) (matches Job Search usage).
- **"Why This May Be Worth Attention" callout:** Changed from accent-tinted surface (color-mix 18% accent) to standard surface2/border (no page-specific accent surfaces that Job Search doesn't use).
- **Trust footer:** Changed from bordered card with Shield icon to compact text line matching Job Search trust cue style.
- **Search input:** Changed from surface2 bg + custom padding to transparent bg with standard border (matches Job Search input style).
- **Metrics strip:** Reduced padding from px-6 py-2.5 to px-4 py-2.

### Structure corrections (Saved Jobs → approved mockup parity)
- **Two-pane workspace:** Changed from flex + borderRight layout to CSS grid with gap-3, px-4, pb-3 — both panes wrapped in rounded-lg border containers with var(--p-surface) bg and var(--p-radius-lg) (matches Job Search panel treatment).
- **Search + Sort/Filter:** Consolidated into a single compact row (search left, sort/filter right) matching Job Search control density.
- **List pane:** Added listbox role, aria-label, overscrollBehavior: contain (matches Job Search results pane).
- **Detail sections:** Reduced px-6 py-4 to px-4 py-3 throughout for tighter section density.
- **Card interactive element:** Added role="option", aria-selected, keyboard handler (Enter/Space) for proper listbox semantics.

### Interaction states verified
- Saved job cards: hover bg change, focus-visible ring, keyboard Enter/Space, selected accent bar (persistent > hover)
- Search input: focus-visible ring
- Sort/Filter buttons: INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS
- Sort dropdown items: hover bg, focus-visible ring, selected accent color
- All action buttons: INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS
- Empty state button: INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS
- Clear search button: INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS

## Files changed (this run)

- `packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.tsx` — full theme+structure parity correction.
- `docs/change-briefs/day-73.md` — run 8 entry.
- `docs/merge-notes/current.md` — this section.

# Day 62 (run 1) — PathAdvisor Context Log (Option A) global v1

**Branch:** `feature/day-62-pathadvisor-context-log-global-v1`  
**Date:** March 5, 2026  
**Status:** In progress

## Summary

- Implemented PathAdvisor Context Log (Option A) as the default app-wide UX: right rail is an append-only context log that grows on meaningful user actions; static Insight cards and rail Privacy pill removed.
- All major screens set stable `screenId` in pathAdvisorScreenOverridesStore and publish context-log entries on selection/CTA clicks (Job Search, Career Readiness, Resume Readiness, Dashboard).
- Job Search: kept Match panel and interactive breakdown; “Details appear in PathAdvisor.” one-liner; job selection and dimension click append entries; added Quick preview (Info) on list rows that appends job summary to PathAdvisor.
- Career Readiness: removed railContent (static Insight/NEXT BEST ACTION); publish on Improve readiness, View top opportunities, gap CTAs, and action-plan toggles.
- Resume Readiness: publish on active resume select, target job select, and tailored-version creation.
- Dashboard: set overrides with screenId `dashboard`; publish on Today’s Focus hero and small focus card CTAs.
- Dedupe keys used throughout so repeated clicks do not spam the log; anchor grouping and entry-count badge in thread header unchanged.

## Files changed (this run)

- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerReadinessScreen.tsx` — railContent removed; publishScreenContext on Improve readiness, View top opportunities, gap CTAs, action-plan toggles.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerScreen.tsx` — publishSelectionContext on resume select, target job select (TailoringTargetJobPicker onJobSelected), tailored-version creation.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` — setOverrides with screenId `dashboard`; publish on small focus card CTAs.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` — handleJobPeek + JobListItem onPeek (Quick preview); publishSelectionContext import.
- `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorCard.tsx` — (no code change this run; Viewing-only chip and context log UI already in place.)
- `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorRail.tsx` — (no code change this run.)

## Gates

- `pnpm lint` — passed (warnings only, no new errors).
- `pnpm -r typecheck` — passed.
- `pnpm test` — passed (804 tests).
- `pnpm build` — passed.
- `pnpm routes:check` — passed.
- `pnpm overlays:check` — passed.

## Human Simulation Gate (manual verification)

1. **Dashboard:** Open app → Dashboard sets Viewing: Dashboard; click Today’s Focus hero CTA → PathAdvisor shows new context entry for that focus; click a small focus card CTA → entry for that card.
2. **Job Search:** Go to Job Search → select a job → PathAdvisor shows “Job match for &lt;title&gt;”; click a Match breakdown row → “Match breakdown: &lt;dimension&gt;” entry; click Quick preview (Info) on a list row → “Quick preview: &lt;title&gt;” with summary excerpt.
3. **Career Readiness:** Go to Career Readiness → click Improve readiness or View top opportunities → corresponding entry in PathAdvisor; click a gap CTA or action-plan checkbox → entry appended; no static Insight card in rail when context log has entries.
4. **Resume Readiness:** Go to Career & Resume → select a resume or target job → PathAdvisor shows selection entry; create tailored version from job → “Tailored version created” entry.
5. **Rail:** No “Privacy: Local only” pill; only “Viewing: …” chip; Clear screen / Clear thread work; anchor headers show entry count.

## Patch artifacts

- **Cumulative:** `artifacts/day-62.patch` (git diff main...HEAD, excluding artifacts).
- **This run:** `artifacts/day-62-this-run.patch` (git diff working tree, excluding artifacts).
- Artifact list/sizes: see Part 6 log (Get-ChildItem artifacts \| Select Name, Length, LastWriteTime); day-62.patch and day-62-this-run.patch updated this run.

## Day 45 - Desktop shell runtime import fix (2026-01-22)

### Summary

- Marked `DesktopShellBounds` as a type-only import in `electron/main.ts` to prevent runtime ESM export errors when Electron loads the main process.

### Follow-ups

- Re-run `pnpm desktop:dev` to confirm the Electron window opens and the bridge loads after this change.

## PathAdvisor single card refactor (PathAdvisorCard + PathAdvisorRail)

**Branch:** `feature/ui-serious-mode-v1`  
**Date:** 2026-02-26

### Summary

- Added `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorCard.tsx`: single ModuleCard with Header → Context pills → Conversation window (scroll, surface2 + border) → Composer (pinned, top divider). Suggested prompts as chips above message list; all PathAdvisor UI inside one card.
- Updated `PathAdvisorRail.tsx` to render only `PathAdvisorCard`; removed floating input and multiple sections. Trust-first microcopy (Viewing, Privacy) remains as compact pills in the card.
- Added `PathAdvisorCard.test.tsx`: smoke tests for rendering messages, suggested prompts, and composer/send button.
- Exported `PathAdvisorCard`, `PathAdvisorCardProps`, `PathAdvisorMessage` from `@pathos/ui`.

## PathAdvisor composer UX and local reaction loop (Day 50)

**Branch:** `feature/ui-serious-mode-v1`  
**Date:** February 26, 2026

### Summary

- Added focus-within ring on PathAdvisor composer container (input + button highlight together).
- Fixed send so it works via form `onSubmit` and button `type="submit"` (Enter and click both send).
- Messages array updates and auto-scroll-to-bottom when new messages append (ref + useEffect on message list).
- Implemented minimal local-only reaction loop in app-level rail: desktop and desktop-preview pass `messages` + `onSend`; onSend appends user message, then setTimeout appends simulated PathAdvisor reply so the rail reacts to input.

### Files changed (this run)

- `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorCard.tsx` — focus-within, form submit, auto-scroll
- `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorRail.tsx` — optional controlled mode (messages + onSend)
- `apps/desktop/src/DesktopApp.tsx` — state + onSend with simulated reply
- `app/desktop-preview/page.tsx` — state + onSend with simulated reply
- `docs/change-briefs/day-50.md` — change brief

# Day 59 — Career Readiness tab v1

**Branch:** `feature/day-59-career-readiness-tab-v1`  
**Date:** March 5, 2026  
**Status:** Implementation complete (do not commit or push)

## Goal

Implement a new Career Readiness tab/screen in the PathOS desktop/web app that matches current PathOS CSS/theme and layout. Screen shows competitiveness baseline (score, trajectory chart, radar chart, gaps, action plan); PathAdvisor rail shows Viewing: Career Readiness with INSIGHT and NEXT BEST ACTION cards.

## Files changed (summary)

- **New:** `packages/ui/src/screens/CareerReadinessScreen.tsx`, `CareerReadinessScreen.test.tsx`, `careerReadiness/ReadinessTrajectoryChart.tsx`, `ReadinessRadarChart.tsx`, `careerReadinessMockData.ts`; `app/(shared)/dashboard/career-readiness/page.tsx`; `docs/change-briefs/day-59.md`
- **Modified:** `packages/ui/src/routes/routes.ts` (CAREER_READINESS route, SIDEBAR_ROUTES); `packages/ui/src/shell/Sidebar.tsx` (Career Readiness nav item after Dashboard, Cog icon, isItemActive); `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorRail.tsx` (pass railContent); `packages/ui/src/shell/PathAdvisorCard.tsx` (railContent: INSIGHT + NEXT BEST ACTION + collapsed sections); `packages/ui/src/stores/pathAdvisorScreenOverridesStore.ts` (PathAdvisorRailContent, railContent on overrides); `packages/ui/src/index.ts` (export CareerReadinessScreen); `apps/desktop/src/DesktopApp.tsx` (route /dashboard/career-readiness → CareerReadinessScreen)

## UX notes

- Nav order: Dashboard, Career Readiness, … (Career Readiness in OVERVIEW section).
- Active state highlights when pathname === CAREER_READINESS.
- PathAdvisor shows "Viewing: Career Readiness", "Privacy: Local only", INSIGHT bullets, NEXT BEST ACTION ("Add 3 quantified accomplishments (+4)." / Start), collapsed "Explain scoring" / "How this works".
- Action Plan checkboxes update "Projected readiness" live (base 74 + sum of selected impacts, clamp 100).
- Evidence & Inputs section collapses/expands; expanded content shows profile fields, resume used, target role, privacy note.
- All data local-only mock; no backend; no persistence of selections in v1.

## Known follow-ups

- Persist action plan selections if a persistence utility is added later.
- Wire "Improve readiness", "View top opportunities", gap CTAs, and PathAdvisor "Start" to real flows when available.
- Consider adding owner-map update if route/screen ownership is tracked.

# Day 59 — Career Readiness UX/layout fixes (second run)

**Branch:** `feature/day-59-career-readiness-tab-v1`  
**Date:** March 5, 2026  
**Status:** UX fixes complete (do not commit or push)

## Goal

Fix UX/layout issues: compact Trajectory card, no radar label clipping, score card target-role microcopy, discoverable Evidence & Inputs, Show assumptions interactive.

## What changed

- ReadinessTrajectoryChart: CHART_HEIGHT 56, tighter padding, wrapper max-h 72px.
- ReadinessRadarChart: viewBox with VIEW_PADDING 44, chart content offset so labels never clip; wrapper padding; fontSize 9.
- CareerReadinessScreen: getTargetRoleMicrocopy() under badge; Evidence & Inputs border accent, "Audit details" badge, hint "See what inputs were used for scoring."; Show assumptions with INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS and expanded placeholder.
- CareerReadinessScreen.test: assert "Baseline competitiveness across common federal roles.", "See what inputs were used for scoring."

# Day 59 — Card proportion + radar label scaling (third run)

**Branch:** feature/day-59-career-readiness-tab-v1  
**Date:** March 5, 2026

## Goal

Fix disproportion between Trajectory and Radar cards; fix radar SVG label scaling bug (labels rendering extremely large).

## What changed

- **Layout:** Grid row min-h-[320px]; both cards h-full flex flex-col; Trajectory content in flex-1 justify-center wrapper so chart is centered and card does not feel empty. Trajectory chart CHART_HEIGHT 72, minHeight 72.
- **Radar:** SVG explicit width/height 220px (RENDER_SIZE) so it never scales; labels stay stable size. Removed width="100%" and maxWidth. Removed unused polygonPoints (lint).

# Day 59 — Readiness Trajectory: Actual vs Possible (v0 parity)

**Branch:** feature/day-59-career-readiness-tab-v1  
**Date:** March 5, 2026

## Goal

Update the Readiness Trajectory chart to match v0 mock: two lines (Actual solid, Possible dashed), compact legend, trust-first microcopy, and hover tooltip showing both values. No new deps; no theme drift.

## What changed

- **Mock data:** Extended to two-series trajectory: `actualPoints` (Today 74, 3 mo 74, 6 mo 75, 12 mo 76) and `possiblePoints` (Today 74, 3 mo 78, 6 mo 84, 12 mo 90). Replaced `trajectoryPoints` with `trajectory: TrajectoryData` on `CareerReadinessMockData`.
- **ReadinessTrajectoryChart:** Accepts `trajectory` (actualPoints + possiblePoints). Renders Actual line (solid, `var(--p-accent)`) and Possible line (dashed, `var(--p-text-dim)`). CHART_HEIGHT 80. Compact legend top-right: "Actual" (solid indicator), "Possible" (dashed indicator). Minimal hover tooltip: label + Actual/Possible values + "Possible assumes selected actions completed." Hit areas for each time point with mouse + keyboard focus.
- **CareerReadinessScreen:** Passes `mock.trajectory` to chart. Microcopy under chart: "Actual shows your progress over time. Possible shows where you could be if you complete selected actions. Local-only." Assumptions list when expanded: "Selected actions completed", "Target role unchanged", "Profile inputs remain consistent".
- **Tests:** New smoke assertion for legend labels ("Actual", "Possible") and exact trust microcopy.

## Why

- v0 parity: users see plan (Possible) vs evidence (Actual) in one chart with clear trust framing.
- Trust-first: microcopy and tooltip explain what each line means and that Possible is conditional.

## Follow-ups

- None. Persistence of trajectory data remains out of scope for this step.

## Human Simulation Gate

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Required | No |
| Triggers hit | none |
| Why | UI-only change (chart, copy, tooltip); no store/persistence/SSR changes. |

## AI Acceptance Checklist

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Flow | Screen reads mock.trajectory → chart renders two lines + legend + tooltip on hover/focus. |
| Store(s) | none |
| Storage key(s) | none |
| Failure mode | Chart shows empty or wrong series if mock shape wrong. |
| How tested | Smoke tests (legend + microcopy); manual hover/focus on chart. |

# Day 59 — ECharts Trajectory upgrade (Actual vs Possible)

**Branch:** feature/day-59-career-readiness-tab-v1

## Summary

- Converted Readiness Trajectory chart from custom SVG to Apache ECharts (two lines: Actual vs Possible, tooltip with Gap and note, legend toggles).
- Added packages/ui deps: echarts, echarts-for-react. New shared chart layer: EChart.tsx (client-only wrapper), pathosChartTheme.ts (getPathosChartColors).
- ReadinessTrajectoryEChart.tsx implements the chart; CareerReadinessScreen uses it. ReadinessTrajectoryChart.tsx deprecated (comment only).

## What changed

- packages/ui/package.json: echarts ^5.5.0, echarts-for-react ^3.0.2
- packages/ui/src/charts/EChart.tsx (new): client-only wrapper, mount then render
- packages/ui/src/charts/pathosChartTheme.ts (new): getPathosChartColors() from CSS vars
- packages/ui/src/screens/careerReadiness/ReadinessTrajectoryEChart.tsx (new): ECharts line chart
- CareerReadinessScreen: import and render ReadinessTrajectoryEChart
- ReadinessTrajectoryChart.tsx: deprecation comment added

# Day 59 — Readiness Radar ECharts (this run)

**Branch:** feature/day-59-career-readiness-tab-v1  
**Date:** March 5, 2026

## Goal

Convert the Readiness Radar chart from SVG to ECharts radar using the existing chart layer (EChart.tsx, pathosChartTheme.ts). Same pattern as Trajectory EChart: client-only, premium tooltip, 5 indicators, 0–100 scale, accessible fallback.

## What changed

- **ReadinessRadarEChart.tsx (new):** ECharts radar with indicators Target Alignment, Specialized Experience, Resume Evidence, Keywords Coverage, Leadership & Scope. Values from mock radarSpokes; scale 0–100. Tooltip: indicator name + value + "Local-only. Derived from profile + resume evidence." Uses getPathosChartColors(); no label clipping; client-only mount.
- **CareerReadinessScreen:** Replaced ReadinessRadarChart with ReadinessRadarEChart. Layout, headings, "Top gaps holding you back" list unchanged.
- **ReadinessRadarChart.tsx:** Deprecation comment added (replaced by ReadinessRadarEChart); file left in place.
- **Accessible fallback:** Visually-hidden &lt;ul&gt; in ReadinessRadarEChart listing the 5 indicators and values for screen readers and test stability.
- **Tests:** CareerReadinessScreen.test.tsx — new test asserts "Readiness Radar" and all 5 indicator labels present (Target Alignment, Specialized Experience, Resume Evidence, Keywords Coverage, Leadership &amp; Scope).

**pnpm test:** 52 test files, 756 tests passed.  
**pnpm build:** Next.js build completed successfully.

### Lint fix (recorded)

| What failed | Why | Fix |
|-------------|-----|-----|
| eslint react-hooks/set-state-in-effect at FilterGuideDrawer.tsx:110 | setState synchronously in useEffect when drawer opens | Wrap setSearchQuery/setSelectedCategory in setTimeout(..., 0) with clearTimeout in effect cleanup so setState is not synchronous in effect body |

## 3) Career Readiness ECharts usage

- CareerReadinessScreen imports and uses **ReadinessTrajectoryEChart** and **ReadinessRadarEChart** only. No imports of ReadinessTrajectoryChart or ReadinessRadarChart.
- Deprecated SVG components (ReadinessTrajectoryChart.tsx, ReadinessRadarChart.tsx) remain in repo with deprecation comments; not used.
- EChart.tsx wrapper: client-only guard (useState mounted + useEffect(setTimeout 0) setMounted(true)); tooltip configured in option by Trajectory/Radar EChart components.

## 4) Docs

- docs/merge-notes.md, docs/merge-notes/current.md, docs/change-briefs/day-59.md updated so Day 59 reflects final gate results (lint/typecheck/test/build).

## 5) Patch Artifacts (FINAL)

- **Cumulative:** `artifacts/day-59.patch` (main → working tree; develop not in repo; excludes artifacts/). UTF-8.

# Day 60 — Dashboard Career Readiness metrics v1

**Branch:** `feature/day-60-dashboard-readiness-metrics-v1`  
**Date:** March 5, 2026  
**Status:** In progress

## Goal

Update Dashboard so it reflects the new Career Readiness system (metrics + gaps + action link), keeping trust-first UX and local-only posture.

## Summary of changes

- **B) Shared local mock snapshot:** `CareerReadinessSummary` and `getCareerReadinessSummary()` in `packages/ui/src/screens/careerReadiness/careerReadinessMockData.ts`. Single source of truth for score, label, updatedAt, top gaps, next best action.
- **C) Readiness tile (Option A refactor):** Briefing row uses shared `BRIEFING_TILE_MIN_H` (160px) so all four tiles (Saved Jobs, Tracked Apps, Readiness, Next Milestone) share the same height contract; Readiness tile no longer expands the row. Readiness tile is compact only: score, label, target, status line, CTA "Open Career Readiness". Inline "Top gaps" list removed from the tile.
- **D) Details popover:** Small "Details" affordance (Info icon button, aria-label "Readiness details") on the Readiness tile opens a Radix Popover with: header "Readiness details", next best action line, "Top gaps" section (3 items: name + impact), footer trust note "Computed locally from profile + resume evidence." Popover trigger is keyboard reachable; portaled to OverlayRoot; Z_POPOVER.
- **E) Do now / Next best move:** focusHero in mockDashboardData driven by `getCareerReadinessSummary().nextBestActionText`; buildDashboardViewModel uses `CAREER_READINESS` for hero actionRoute; handleDoNow appends `#action-plan` when navigating to Career Readiness; CareerReadinessScreen has `id="action-plan"` and scroll-into-view on hash. Hero CTA and tile CTA both route to Career Readiness (hero → #action-plan).
- **F) Tests:** DashboardScreen.test.tsx: Readiness tile shows 74/100, "Open Career Readiness", no inline "Top gaps" list, Details trigger (aria-label "Readiness details"); careerReadinessMockData.test.ts; buildDashboardViewModel (hero route CAREER_READINESS). pnpm test: 767 passed.

## Gates

- **pnpm lint:** 0 errors, 26 warnings.
- **pnpm -r typecheck:** Pass.
- **pnpm test:** 767 tests passed.
- **pnpm build:** Pass.

# Day 60 (run 2) — Briefing row primary metrics emphasis

**Branch:** `feature/day-60-dashboard-readiness-metrics-v1`  
**Date:** March 5, 2026  
**Goal:** Make briefing row primary metrics stand out more (numbers as key markers) while keeping design restrained and consistent across tiles.

## Summary of changes

- **Shared PrimaryMetric style:** Added `PRIMARY_METRIC_VALUE_STYLE` (1.125rem, bold, --p-text), `PRIMARY_METRIC_LABEL_STYLE` (11px, --p-text-muted), `PRIMARY_METRIC_STATUS_STYLE` (11px, --p-text-dim), and `BRIEFING_TILE_CTA_CLASS` (muted accent, hover underline). No new theme colors.
- **BriefingTile:** Primary value uses PRIMARY_METRIC_VALUE_STYLE; subtext (deltas) uses font-medium and --p-success when subtextPositive, else --p-text-muted.
- **ReadinessBriefingTile:** Readiness score split into score (bold, larger) + "/100" (muted, smaller) on one line; label/target/status use shared styles; CTA uses BRIEFING_TILE_CTA_CLASS and --p-accent-muted.
- **Tests:** DashboardScreen.test.tsx updated: Readiness score assertion looks for score and "/100" separately; added assertion for Saved Jobs and Tracked Apps tiles in briefing row.

## Gates (this run)

- **pnpm lint:** 0 errors, 26 warnings.
- **pnpm -r typecheck:** Pass.

# Day 60 (run 3) — Briefing tiles uniform; Details popover; primary metrics enlarged; CTAs standardized

**Branch:** `feature/day-60-dashboard-readiness-metrics-v1`  
**Date:** March 5, 2026  
**Goal:** Refine Dashboard BRIEFING tiles: uniform header (title left, optional single Details icon right), larger primary metrics, standardized CTA slot, Readiness context in Details popover only, exactly one icon on Readiness tile.

## Summary of changes

- **Header unified:** All briefing tiles: left = title (Saved Jobs / Tracked Apps / Readiness / Next Milestone); right = optional single Details icon (Readiness only). Removed decorative icons (FolderOpen, FileText, HelpCircle, Eye) from headers; removed duplicate Info + HelpCircle on Readiness so exactly one Details (Info) icon with aria-label "Readiness details".
- **Primary metrics enlarged:** `PRIMARY_METRIC_VALUE_STYLE` set to 1.625rem (26px), bold, compact line-height. Next Milestone value (text) uses `PRIMARY_METRIC_HEADLINE_STYLE` (18px semibold). Saved Jobs "3", Tracked Apps "2", Readiness "74/100" all visibly large.
- **Readiness tile body simplified:** Removed "Target: General readiness" and "Local-only • Updated 2 min ago" from tile body. Details popover now includes: Target, Privacy: Local-only, Updated: {timestamp}, Next best action, Top gaps (3), footer "Computed locally from profile + resume evidence."
- **CTAs standardized:** All four tiles use same CTA slot and `BRIEFING_TILE_CTA_CLASS`. Text: "Open Saved Jobs", "Open Applications", "Open Career Readiness", "Open Status". Routes: SAVED_JOBS, IMPORT, CAREER_READINESS, IMPORT.
- **Tests:** DashboardScreen.test.tsx — titles (all four), Readiness "74" and "/100", CTAs (Open Career Readiness, Open Saved Jobs, one more Open …), exactly one aria-label "Readiness details"; removed unstable popover-content assertion (portaled content not in renderToString).

## Gates (this run)

- **pnpm lint:** Pass (0 new errors).
- **pnpm -r typecheck:** Pass.
- **pnpm test:** 767 tests passed (DashboardScreen 6 tests).

# Day 61 (run 1) — Job Search Job Match Snapshot v1

**Branch:** `feature/day-61-job-search-jobmatchsnapshot-v1`  
**Date:** March 5, 2026  
**Goal:** Create a clear, deterministic mapping between Career Readiness and selected job. Implement local-only JobMatchSnapshot v1 and render Match Breakdown in the Job Search "PathOS Snapshot" panel.

## Summary of changes

- **JobMatchSnapshot v1 contract:** New `packages/ui/src/lib/jobMatchSnapshot.ts` with types MatchLevel, JobDemandProfile, JobMatchDimension, JobMatchSnapshot; exports buildJobDemandProfile(job), buildJobMatchSnapshot(readiness, job), buildReadinessInputFromMock(mock). Demand profile weights (baseline 0.20 each) adjusted by evidenceHeavy (specialized text length > 400 or checklist count >= 6 or summary length > 220), keywordHeavy (keywords >= 10), leadershipHeavy (job text contains lead/manage/supervise/stakeholder/program/portfolio/enterprise/strategy/budget/governance). Weights clamped to [0.10, 0.35] and renormalized. Match score per dimension: readinessScore - demandPenalty (6 when flag + dimension match), status Good/Mixed/Weak from bands 75+/55–74/<55. Primary blocker: missing inputs → "Missing readiness inputs"; else highest-weight Weak dimension → "<Dimension> is limiting competitiveness"; else "None detected. Improve the top gap." Missing evidence list (2–5 items) from weak/mixed dimensions. topJobRelevantGap from readiness gaps aligned to weakest dimension. audit.rulesFired and audit.localOnly: true.
- **Readiness inputs:** Career Readiness mock (CAREER_READINESS_MOCK) supplies overall score/max, label, radarSpokes (mapped to 5 dimension scores, "Specialized Exp" → "Specialized Experience"), topGaps, actionPlanItems. Job data: series from summary "Series NNNN", grade from job.grade, keywords from getChecklistForJob(job.id).skillsKeywords, specialized experience from checklist specializedExperience (length and text length for evidenceHeavy).
- **UI — Match for this job panel:** Job Search details panel (above tabs) renamed to "Match for this job". Shows MatchLevel badge, one-line "Based on your readiness (74/100) and this announcement's requirements.", Match breakdown (5 rows: label, status chip, inline bar, why sentence), "What you're missing" (2–5 bullets), primary blocker line (JobMatchSnapshot.primaryBlocker), and CTA "Open Career Readiness: Fix &lt;topJobRelevantGap.label&gt; (+&lt;impact&gt;)" navigating to CAREER_READINESS + '#action-plan'. Explain in PathAdvisor retained.
- **PathAdvisor rail:** When a job is selected, overrides set viewingLabel: Job Search, suggestedPrompts to job-aware ("Why is this a stretch for me?", "Show what evidence I'm missing", "What will move my score fastest?"), railContent with 3 insight bullets (match level/score, top limiting factor, fastest improvement) and nextBestAction (Fix &lt;gap&gt; + impact). onRailNextBestActionClick navigates to Career Readiness #action-plan. pathAdvisorScreenOverridesStore and PathAdvisorCard support optional onRailNextBestActionClick.
- **Tests:** jobMatchSnapshot.test.ts (buildReadinessInputFromMock, buildJobDemandProfile, buildJobMatchSnapshot: 5 dimensions, overallReadinessScore/Max, primaryBlocker includes dimension or fallback, matchLevel, topJobRelevantGap, audit). JobSearchScreen.test.tsx: "Match for this job" when job selected (or loading); when snapshot visible, Match breakdown rows include at least two dimension labels, 74/100 in copy, Open Career Readiness CTA, primary blocker line present.

## Gates (this run)

- **pnpm lint:** Pass.
- **pnpm -r typecheck:** Pass.
- **pnpm test:** 780 tests passed (JobSearchScreen 23, jobMatchSnapshot 9).
- **pnpm build:** Pass.

# Day 61 (run 2) — Match Breakdown interactive rows + dimension briefing

**Branch:** `feature/day-61-job-search-jobmatchsnapshot-v1`  
**Date:** March 5, 2026  
**Goal:** Make Job Search MATCH BREAKDOWN rows meaningfully interactive; drill into each dimension via PathAdvisor rail (briefing). No commit or push.

## Pre-flight logging

- **git status:** On branch feature/day-61-job-search-jobmatchsnapshot-v1; changes not staged (docs/change-briefs/day-61.md, docs/merge-notes.md, docs/merge-notes/current.md, jobMatchSnapshot.test.ts, jobMatchSnapshot.ts, JobSearchScreen.test.tsx, JobSearchScreen.tsx, PathAdvisorCard.tsx, PathAdvisorRail.tsx, pathAdvisorBriefingStore.ts, pathAdvisorScreenOverridesStore.ts).
- **git branch --show-current:** feature/day-61-job-search-jobmatchsnapshot-v1.
- **git diff --name-status main...HEAD:** (develop not present; baseline main) — see diff --name-status main -- . below.
- **pnpm -v:** 10.28.1. **node -v:** v24.13.0.

## What changed

- **Interactive Match Breakdown rows:** Each dimension row is a button: INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS, cursor-pointer, focus-visible ring (var(--p-accent)), click opens PathAdvisor dimension briefing; Enter/Space trigger same action. Tooltip on each row: "User: &lt;readinessScore&gt;/100 • Job emphasis: High|Medium|Low • Gap: &lt;100 − matchScore&gt;". Canonical Tooltip component; no inline role="tooltip", no Tailwind z-*.
- **Dimension briefing (PathAdvisor rail):** Clicking a row opens a generic PathAdvisor briefing with title "Match breakdown: &lt;Dimension&gt;", sourceLabel "Job Search", sections: What this measures, Your current signal, Evidence found, Evidence missing, Fastest fix. primaryCta: Resume Evidence → "Fix Resume Evidence (+N)" → Career Readiness #action-plan; other dimensions → "Improve &lt;Dimension&gt; (+N)" → same route.
- **pathAdvisorBriefingStore:** PathAdvisorBriefing extended with optional primaryCta: { label, route }. PathAdvisorCard renders generic briefing title when set and a primary CTA button that nav.push(primaryCta.route).
- **jobMatchSnapshot.ts:** MissingEvidenceItem.dimensionKey added; buildDimensionBriefingPayload(dim, snapshot, actionPlanRoute) returns DimensionBriefingPayload (title, sourceLabel, sections, primaryCta). DIMENSION_WHAT_MEASURES static copy per dimension; jobEmphasisLevel(demandWeight); evidence found/missing and fastest fix derived deterministically.
- **Tests:** jobMatchSnapshot.test.ts — buildDimensionBriefingPayload: title/sourceLabel, 5 sections, primaryCta for Resume Evidence. JobSearchScreen.test.tsx — "opening dimension briefing for Resume Evidence sets PathAdvisor briefing with title containing Resume Evidence" (build payload, openBriefing, assert store).

## Commands + pass/fail

- **pnpm lint:** Pass.
- **pnpm -r typecheck:** Pass.
- **pnpm test:** 784 tests passed (JobSearchScreen 24, jobMatchSnapshot 12).
- **pnpm build:** Pass.
- **pnpm routes:check:** OK — all Sidebar routes resolve in Desktop and Next.
- **pnpm overlays:check:** Fail (pre-existing: ReadinessTrajectoryChart.tsx; not introduced by this change).

# Day 61 (run 3) — Option A: Match badge in list; readiness vs job match clarity; breakdown affordance

**Branch:** `feature/day-61-job-search-jobmatchsnapshot-v1`  
**Date:** March 5, 2026  
**Goal:** Polish JobMatchSnapshot UI; Option A — replace list fit stars with Match badge + score; clarify readiness vs job match; make breakdown rows obviously interactive.

## Summary of changes

- **List rows (Option A):** Removed fit stars, confidence chip, and "Why this fit?". Replaced with Match badge (Strong/Moderate/Stretch) and match score (e.g. 68/100) from same JobMatchSnapshot builder; per-row snapshot cached with useMemo(keyed by readinessInput + sortedResults).
- **Match panel header:** "Readiness: 74/100" and "Job match: 68/100 (Moderate)" shown explicitly; one microcopy line: "Job match weights what this announcement emphasizes most."
- **Match breakdown rows:** Right-edge chevron (visible on hover/focus-visible); row hover border/background (token-only); per-dimension "User: 58/100" shown without tooltip; aria-label "Open dimension details for &lt;dimension&gt;"; Enter/Space open dimension briefing (unchanged).
- **Single entrypoint:** "Explain this in PathAdvisor" renamed to "Explain this match" in details panel; no duplicate link on list rows.
- **Tests:** JobSearchScreen — match panel shows Readiness + Job match; at least one row has Match badge and /100 (when panel visible); "Why this fit?" absent; at least one "Open dimension details" in aria-label. Explain this match test renamed.

**Date:** March 5, 2026  
**Goal:** Option A2 left-edge match bar on job list rows; deterministic demo match variety for mock jobs; match score more visible in list row; tests and gates.

## Summary of changes

- **Option A2 — Left match bar:** Job list rows now show a 2px left-edge bar by match level (Strong = var(--p-success), Moderate = var(--p-accent-muted), Stretch = var(--p-border-strong)). Bar is always present (position absolute left-0); selection is background-only (no double bar). Row padding adjusted (pl-[calc(0.75rem+2px)]) so content does not overlap the bar. No layout shift; no new hardcoded colors.
- **Demo fake match variety:** In jobMatchSnapshot.ts added isMockJob(job), getDemoTargetMatchScore(jobId) with cycle [86, 78, 70, 62, 54, 46]. For mock jobs (id mock-js-*), snapshot is adjusted to target score; dimensions and overallMatchScore/matchLevel/primaryBlocker recomputed; audit.rulesFired gets "demoMatchVariety" and "demoTargetScore:&lt;n&gt;". List and details panel both use buildJobMatchSnapshot so scores are consistent.
- **Match score visibility (C):** List row score shown as "68/100" with number at fontWeight 600 and /100 muted; no new label or line.
- **Tests:** After loadSampleJobs, assert list contains at least two different match labels (Strong/Moderate/Stretch); when details panel visible, assert "Job match:" present. Existing /100 and Match for this job assertions retained.

## Gates

- **pnpm lint:** Pass (warnings only).
- **pnpm -r typecheck:** Pass.
- **pnpm test:** 790 passed (JobSearchScreen 30 tests).
- **pnpm build:** Pass.
- **pnpm overlays:check:** Fail (pre-existing ReadinessTrajectoryChart.tsx; not introduced by this run).

## overlays:check fix (ReadinessTrajectoryChart)

**Goal:** Make `pnpm overlays:check` pass by fixing pre-existing violations.

**Failure excerpt (before fix):**
```
[overlays:check] Tailwind z- in className (use zIndex.ts + inline style): packages\ui\src\screens\careerReadiness\ReadinessTrajectoryChart.tsx
[overlays:check] role="tooltip" found (use Tooltip component): packages\ui\src\screens\careerReadiness\ReadinessTrajectoryChart.tsx
```
- File: `packages/ui/src/screens/careerReadiness/ReadinessTrajectoryChart.tsx`
- Violations: (1) `className="... z-10 ..."` on inline tooltip div; (2) inline tooltip div with `role="tooltip"` and `id="readiness-trajectory-tooltip"`.

**Changes made:**
- Removed Tailwind `z-10` and the entire inline tooltip div (no z-index constant needed in this file; tooltip is portaled).
- Replaced inline tooltip with the canonical `Tooltip` component from `packages/ui/src/components/Tooltip.tsx` (portaled via OverlayRoot, uses Z_TOOLTIP internally).
- Each chart hit area (one per time point) is now wrapped in `<Tooltip content={pointTooltipContent(i)} side="top">` with a `<g>` trigger containing the `<rect>`; tooltip content is label, Actual/Possible scores, and trust note (token-only styling).
- Removed `useState`/`useCallback` for hover; tooltip open state is per-trigger via Radix.

**Commands run:**
- `pnpm overlays:check` — PASS
- `pnpm -r typecheck` — PASS
- `pnpm test` — PASS (56 test files, 804 tests)
- `pnpm docs:day-patches --day 62` — FAIL (pathspec exclude / diff baseline); patch artifacts not regenerated this run.

**git status (after fix):**
- Branch: `feature/day-62-pathadvisor-context-log-global-v1`
- Modified: `docs/merge-notes/current.md`, `packages/ui/src/screens/careerReadiness/ReadinessTrajectoryChart.tsx` (plus existing day-62 changes).

# Day 73 — Generic frontend interaction-state rule (March 14, 2026)

**Branch:** `savedJobsPage`  
**Status:** In progress

## Summary

Added a reusable frontend guidance rule so interactive PathOS UI surfaces are expected to show visible feedback states by default. The canonical rule now lives in `docs/ai/cursor-house-rules.md`, with a short reinforcement note in `AGENTS.md` for discoverability during builder runs.

## Files changed

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/ai/cursor-house-rules.md`
- `docs/change-briefs/day-73.md`
- `docs/merge-notes/current.md`

## Rule added

- Interactive surfaces must not remain visually static by default unless there is a strong product reason.
- Cover the states that apply to the control: `hover`, `focus-visible`, `active` or `pressed`, and `selected` or `current` where relevant.
- Users must be able to tell what is clickable, what is focused, what is selected, and what state a control is in across pointer and keyboard use.
- Apply this expectation broadly to buttons, cards, tabs, nav items, dropdown triggers, chips, list rows, clickable panels, sidebar actions, and similar interactive surfaces.
- Selected or current state must remain more persistent and visually stronger than hover.

## Validation performed

- Reviewed frontend AI guidance and repo entry-point docs to choose a canonical location.
- No code tests run. This was a docs-only update.

## Git logging

- `git branch --show-current`: `savedJobsPage`
- `git diff --name-status develop...HEAD`: no output
- `git diff --stat develop...HEAD`: no output

# Day 73 (run 5) — Instruction stack cleanup

**Branch:** `savedJobsPage`  
**Date:** March 14, 2026  
**Status:** In progress

## Summary

Rewrote the root and frontend instruction stack so the docs function as execution-guidance documents instead of role-defining documents. Added an explicit precedence model, separated hard constraints from soft execution preferences, cleaned compatibility pointers, and rewrote the Saved Jobs task so parity is the output target and screen-level structural correction is allowed inside the targeted page surface.

# Run 9 — Page-only structural parity pass

**Branch:** `savedJobsPage`
**Date:** March 14, 2026
**Status:** Complete

## Summary

Page-only structural parity pass for the Saved Jobs page. Brought header, metrics strip, left list pane, detail workspace, and overall proportions materially closer to the approved mockup. No PathAdvisor changes, no Job Search changes, no broad theme tuning.

## Files changed

- `packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.tsx`
- `docs/change-briefs/day-73.md`
- `docs/merge-notes/current.md`

## Structural corrections

- Header: title `text-2xl font-bold`; search icon inside input; sort shows "Sort" label
- Metrics strip: `flex-1` even distribution; more padding/breathing room
- Left pane: accent-tinted selected card background; 3px accent bar; better card padding
- Detail: more section spacing; accent-tinted attention box; inline action row (not sticky)
- Grid: left pane 30% instead of 33%; slightly wider gutter

## Validation

- Linter: no errors
- Manual check: `/dashboard/saved-jobs`

## Git logging

- `git branch --show-current`: `savedJobsPage`
- `git diff --name-status`: working tree changes only (no commits ahead of develop)

# Run: Day 73 — Add deterministic mock data to Saved Jobs

**Date:** 2026-03-14
**Branch:** savedJobsPage
**Task:** Populate the Saved Jobs page with deterministic fake data for mockup density

## Summary

Added a deterministic 8-entry mock dataset for the Saved Jobs page so it renders fully populated during development. When the saved-jobs localStorage store is empty, the screen auto-seeds with the mock data on mount. The dataset exercises all mockup UI surfaces: varied statuses, match scores, grades, salary ranges, close dates, telework types, appointment types, and realistic summaries. No type additions needed — the Job interface already had all required fields.

## Files changed (this run)

- `packages/core/src/saved-jobs-mock-data.ts` — NEW: deterministic mock dataset + seedSavedJobsIfEmpty()
- `packages/core/src/index.ts` — export seedSavedJobsIfEmpty and createSavedJobsMockData
- `packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.tsx` — import and call seedSavedJobsIfEmpty in mount effect

## Behavior changes

- When localStorage has no saved jobs, the page auto-seeds 8 mock entries and selects the first
- Mock data persists to localStorage so it survives refresh
- Existing saved jobs are never overwritten (seedSavedJobsIfEmpty guards on non-empty store)
- PathAdvisor rail content derives from mock data (3 high-match, 2 needs-review, closing-soon counts)
- Metrics strip now shows intentional counts: 8 total, 2 ready, 2 needs-review, 3 high-match, recent count based on 7-day window

## Git logging

- `git branch --show-current`: savedJobsPage
- `git status`: 1 new untracked file (saved-jobs-mock-data.ts), modified index.ts + SavedJobsScreen.tsx + docs
- `git diff --name-status`: A/M across 20+ files (cumulative branch work)
- `git diff --stat`: ~2700 insertions, ~920 deletions (cumulative)

## Patch artifacts

- `artifacts/day-73.patch` (cumulative, develop to working tree)
- `artifacts/day-73-this-run.patch` (incremental, working tree)

# Day 73 — Run 3: Saved Jobs parity correction pass

Date: 2026-03-14
Branch: savedJobsPage

## Summary

Corrected three specific defects in the Saved Jobs page (/dashboard/saved-jobs):

1. **Detail pane content density** — Added Position Details key-value table, Required Documents checklist, enhanced Readiness & Considerations section with dual readiness/match scores and job-specific derived bullets. Detail workspace now has 8 distinct content sections for proper layout evaluation.

2. **Row interaction model** — Removed expanding inline Guided Apply/Remove buttons that grew the row on selection. Replaced with compact right-side icon buttons (quick preview + remove) matching Job Search's JobListItem pattern. Row height is now stable.

3. **Summary metric cards** — Increased padding (px-4 py-3.5), icon container (w-10 h-10), value size (text-2xl), label size (text-[11px]), and shadow depth. Cards now read as meaningful summary tiles, not compact chips.

## Files changed (this run)

- `packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.tsx` — all three fixes applied

## Behavior changes

- Saved-job rows no longer expand to reveal inline action buttons
- Rows have compact ChevronRight (peek) and Trash2 (remove) icons on the right
- Quick preview selects the job so the detail workspace shows it
- Detail pane now shows: header + metadata pills, PathOS Brief, Readiness & Considerations (with readiness + match scores + derived bullets), Position Details table, Required Documents, Why This May Be Worth Attention callout, action row, trust footer
- Metric cards are visually larger with bigger numbers, labels, and icon containers

## Git logging

- `git branch --show-current`: savedJobsPage
- `git status`: M packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.tsx + 19 other branch files
- `git diff --stat`: ~2913 insertions, ~917 deletions (cumulative)

# Day 73 — Run 4: Saved Jobs refinement pass (row action fix, PathOS Brief, interaction-state guidance)

Date: 2026-03-14
Branch: savedJobsPage

## Summary

Targeted refinement pass on the Saved Jobs page with three scoped changes:

1. **Row action defect** — Removed extra ChevronRight icon above the trash icon in each saved-job row. Only the Trash2 icon remains, vertically centered. Row height stable. No expanding row buttons.

2. **PathOS Brief expansion** — Replaced the thin single-paragraph Brief with a structured decision-intelligence section: Role Fit, Strategic Relevance, Strengths (green bullets), Risks (red bullets), Career Trajectory, Timing (with Urgent badge), and Recommendation (accent-tinted callout). All content is derived from job data fields.

3. **Interaction-state guidance** — Updated `docs/ai/cursor-house-rules.md` with a formal Interaction-State Standard (required states table, control type list, consistency rules). Added cross-reference in `AGENTS.md`.

## Files changed (this run)

- `packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.tsx` — row action fix + PathOS Brief expansion
- `docs/ai/cursor-house-rules.md` — interaction-state standard
- `AGENTS.md` — cross-reference

## Behavior changes

- Saved-job rows no longer show a ChevronRight icon; only Trash2 (remove) icon on right side, vertically centered
- PathOS Brief in detail pane now shows 7 structured sub-sections instead of one paragraph
- `handlePeekJob` callback and `onPeek` prop removed (ChevronRight was the only consumer)

## Day 73 — Detail workspace polish and structural stabilization pass — March 15, 2026

### Date: March 15, 2026

### Goal
Bring the Saved Jobs selected-job detail panel to professional workspace quality. Fix the layout and navigation design so the center detail panel reads as a structured review workspace with fixed structural zones and an independently scrolling content viewport.

### What changed

**A. Workspace frame restructuring:**
- Replaced the single `overflow-y-auto` root wrapper with a five-zone flex-column workspace frame
- Zones: (1) Header, (2) Mode strip, (3) Section nav (announcement only), (4) Scrollable content viewport, (5) Action bar + trust footer
- Each fixed zone uses `flex-shrink-0` so it stays in place regardless of content length
- Only the content viewport (zone 4) scrolls, using `flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-y-auto`
- The action bar no longer drifts vertically when switching tabs or when content length changes

**B. Mode switch redesigned:**
- Replaced filled/bordered button pair with a professional segmented workspace mode strip
- Uses underline-accent tab treatment: active mode gets accent text + 2px accent bottom bar; inactive mode uses dim text with no underline
- Reads as workspace mode navigation, not ordinary buttons
- Uppercase tracking-wide font-semibold for restrained, serious visual treatment
- Each tab has `INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS` for hover background + `focus-visible:ring-2` for keyboard focus

**C. Announcement section nav redesigned:**
- Extracted section tabs from inside the scrollable announcement content to a fixed zone above the scroll container
- Replaced rounded-md pill/chip buttons with low-profile text tabs using underline-accent treatment
- Active section gets accent text + 2px accent bottom bar; inactive sections use dim text
- No rounded backgrounds, no pill borders, no chip styling — reads as professional document navigation
- Tabs remain fixed while announcement content scrolls independently below

**D. Scrollable content viewport:**
- Content viewport wraps only the Decision View and Announcement View content
- Uses `overscrollBehavior: contain` to prevent scroll chaining to the parent
- Decision View content (job details + match intelligence) scrolls naturally
- Announcement View content scrolls independently while section tabs stay fixed above

**E. Action bar and trust footer pinned:**
- Action bar (Guided Apply, Open Official Listing, Ask PathAdvisor, Remove from Saved) is now outside the scroll container
- Uses `flex-shrink-0` and sits in the workspace frame below the scroll viewport
- Trust footer also pinned below the action bar with `flex-shrink-0`
- Neither element moves when switching between modes or when content length changes

### Files changed this run
- `packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.tsx` (M) — workspace frame restructuring, mode switch redesign, section nav redesign, scroll container, action bar pinning

### Interaction states verified
- Mode strip tabs: hover (INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS), focus-visible (ring-2 ring-accent), selected (accent text + 2px underline)
- Section nav tabs: hover (INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS), focus-visible (ring-2 ring-accent), selected (accent text + 2px underline)
- Action bar buttons: unchanged (already had INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS and focus-visible states)
- All pre-existing interaction states in the detail workspace preserved

### Validation performed
- Linter: clean (no errors in SavedJobsScreen.tsx)
- Typecheck: pass (pre-existing test file module resolution error only, not related to this run)
- Structural review: workspace frame has correct 5-zone layout; scroll container wraps only content; action bar is outside scroll
- Mode switch reads as professional workspace mode navigation, not cheap button pair
- Announcement section nav reads as professional document navigation, not toy tabs
- Action bar position is structurally stable regardless of content length or active tab

### Patch artifacts
- Cumulative: `artifacts/day-73.patch` (282.4 KB)
- Incremental: `artifacts/day-73-this-run.patch` (282.4 KB)

## Run 4 — Decision View Refinement (Day 73, late evening)

**Branch:** savedJobsPage
**Baseline:** develop (no commits ahead — all working tree changes)

### Summary

Refined the Saved Jobs Decision View to be more professional, decision-first, and structurally stable. Three targeted changes:

1. **Interaction states for mode switch and sub-nav**: Replaced INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS (background-fill hover) with dedicated WorkspaceModeTab and AnnouncementSectionTab components that manage their own hover/active/selected states via useState. Underline-accent pattern reads as workspace mode navigation, not action buttons. Each tab now has: hover (text brightens + faint underline), focus-visible (accent ring), active (opacity reduction), selected (accent text + 2px bar + subtle bg tint). Selected state survives hover without regression.

2. **Decision-first summary band**: Replaced the 10-row flat metadata grid with a compact 4-tile primary strip (Salary, Grade+Promotion, Work Mode, Deadline) and a secondary inline metadata row (Location, Appointment, Status). Removed "Saved" and "Schedule" from the decision summary — user already knows the job is saved, and Schedule is almost always Full-time. Salary is now the first thing the user sees, in success green. Grade+Promotion uses an arrow (→) to show trajectory. Deadline uses accent color when closing soon.

3. **Interaction-state standard tightened**: Added "Mode switches and segmented controls" and "Section-level sub-navigation" explicitly to the Controls list and Implementation Patterns table in cursor-house-rules.md. Added a prevention rule pointing to the reference implementation. This prevents revisiting the same interaction-state gap on future pages.

### UX decisions

**Mode switch treatment:**
- WorkspaceModeTab uses per-tab useState for hover and active tracking
- Hover (not selected): text brightens from dim to muted; faint dim underline hint
- Hover (selected): no visual change — selected state is persistent and dominant
- Active/pressed: 0.75 opacity reduction confirming click
- Selected: accent text + 2px accent bottom bar + 5% accent background tint
- Background-fill hover (from INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS) intentionally NOT used — conflicts with underline tab semantics

**Announcement sub-nav treatment:**
- AnnouncementSectionTab uses same pattern, slightly lighter (section-level vs mode-level)
- Selected: 4% accent bg tint (vs 5% for mode switch) — visual hierarchy preserved

**Decision summary band:**
- Primary 4 tiles: Salary (success green), Grade+Promotion (text color, arrow notation), Work Mode, Deadline (accent when soon)
- Secondary row: Location (with MapPin icon), Appointment type, Status — all dimmer, smaller
- Removed: Saved date (wastes prime space), Schedule (almost always Full-time)

### Anchored footer / scrollable middle

No structural changes to the anchored footer mechanism — it was already correct from prior runs:
- FIXED ZONE 4 (action bar) uses flex-shrink-0 outside the overflow-y-auto scroll container
- FIXED ZONE 5 (trust footer) also uses flex-shrink-0 below the action bar
- Only the content viewport between the mode strip and action bar scrolls

The decision summary band change reduces vertical space consumed above Match Intelligence, so more of the analytical content is visible at first glance before scrolling is needed.

### Files changed this run
- `packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.tsx` (M) — added WorkspaceModeTab and AnnouncementSectionTab components; replaced mode switch and sub-nav; replaced Job Details grid with decision-first summary band
- `docs/ai/cursor-house-rules.md` (M) — added mode switches, segmented controls, and section sub-nav to interaction-state standard

### Interaction states verified
- Mode strip tabs: hover (text brightens + underline hint), focus-visible (ring-2 ring-accent), active (opacity 0.75), selected (accent text + 2px bar + bg tint)
- Section nav tabs: hover (text brightens + underline hint), focus-visible (ring-2 ring-accent), active (opacity 0.75), selected (accent text + 2px bar + bg tint)
- Action bar buttons: unchanged (already had INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS and focus-visible)
- Sort/Filter buttons: unchanged (already had INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS and focus-visible)
- Saved job rows: unchanged (already had useState hover + accent-tinted selection)
- Row trash icon: unchanged (already had INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS)

### Validation performed
- Linter: clean (no errors in SavedJobsScreen.tsx)
- Structural review: decision summary band renders 4 primary tiles + secondary row; mode switch uses WorkspaceModeTab; sub-nav uses AnnouncementSectionTab
- cursor-house-rules.md updated with two new control types and reference implementation pointer

## Run 5 — Shared Score Tier Colors (Day 73, late evening)

**Branch:** savedJobsPage
**Baseline:** develop (no commits ahead — all working tree changes)

### Summary

Extracted score-to-color mapping into a shared module (`styles/scoreTiers.ts`) and corrected the color scale from green/blue/amber to green/amber/red. This makes readiness scores visually scannable using a universally understood traffic-light severity gradient.

### Changes

1. **Created `packages/ui/src/styles/scoreTiers.ts`**: Shared module exporting `scoreTierColor()` and threshold constants (`SCORE_TIER_STRONG = 80`, `SCORE_TIER_MEDIUM = 60`). Deterministic, pure, reusable by Saved Jobs, Job Search, and future surfaces.

2. **Updated `SavedJobsScreen.tsx`**: Removed local `dimensionScoreColor()` function. Imported `scoreTierColor` from the shared module. Replaced all 9 call sites. Also fixed:
   - Gap-state colors: Adequate now uses `--p-warning` (amber), Gap now uses `--p-danger` (red) — previously Adequate used `--p-accent` (blue) and Gap used `--p-warning` (amber).
   - Limiting Factor label: now uses `--p-danger` (red) since it represents the weakest dimension.

3. **Updated `docs/ai/cursor-house-rules.md`**: Score-tier rule now specifies green/amber/red scale and points to `scoreTierColor()` as the canonical implementation.

### Color scale change

| Tier | Old color | New color | Token |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Strong (>=80) | green (`--p-success`) | green (`--p-success`) | unchanged |
| Medium (>=60) | blue (`--p-accent`) | amber (`--p-warning`) | changed |
| Weak (<60) | amber (`--p-warning`) | red (`--p-danger`) | changed |

### Files changed this run
- `packages/ui/src/styles/scoreTiers.ts` (A) — new shared score-tier color module
- `packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.tsx` (M) — replaced local function with shared import; fixed gap-state and limiting factor colors
- `docs/ai/cursor-house-rules.md` (M) — updated score-tier rule

### Validation
- Linter: clean (no errors in SavedJobsScreen.tsx or scoreTiers.ts)
- All `dimensionScoreColor` references removed (0 remaining)
- 9 call sites now use `scoreTierColor` from shared module
- Gap-state colors consistent with score-tier scale

### Git state
- `git branch --show-current`: savedJobsPage
- No commits made. No push.

## Day 74 — Run 2: Job Search Layout Parity with Saved Jobs (March 15, 2026)

**Branch:** `feature/day-74-job-search-parity-with-saved-jobs-v1`
**Scope:** Job Search workspace grid proportions + helper string removal.

### What changed
- **Grid proportions:** Changed Job Search two-pane grid from `clamp(480px, 38vw, 560px) minmax(420px, 1fr)` to `clamp(250px, 30%, 360px) minmax(320px, 1fr)` — matching Saved Jobs exactly. This narrows the left results column from ~480-560px to ~250-360px and gives the center detail workspace the remaining space.
- **Grid gap/padding/margin:** Changed `gap-4 mt-4` (no horizontal padding) to `gap-3.5 mt-3 px-4 pb-3` — matching Saved Jobs spacing.
- **Removed helper strings:**
  - "PathOS will translate it into filters you can review." (below Describe CTA)
  - "Results shown from saved snapshots (mock). Sorted by..." (above filters bar)
- **No changes to Saved Jobs.** No changes to interaction states, search controls, or Job Search-specific functionality.

### Files changed this run
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` (M) — grid layout, spacing, removed 2 helper strings

### Commands run
- `pnpm typecheck` — passed (exit 0)
- `pnpm test -- JobSearchScreen` — 44 tests passed
- `pnpm test -- SavedJobsScreen` — 10 tests passed
- Linter: clean (no errors)

### Git state
- `git branch --show-current`: `feature/day-74-job-search-parity-with-saved-jobs-v1`
- `git status`: 3 files modified (merge-notes, JobSearchScreen.tsx, JobSearchScreen.test.tsx — test file was modified in a prior run)
- `git diff --name-status develop...HEAD`: empty (no commits on branch)
- `git diff --stat develop...HEAD`: empty (all changes in working tree)
- No commits made. No push.

### Patch artifacts
- `artifacts/day-74.patch` — cumulative working-tree diff (develop to working tree)
- `artifacts/day-74-this-run.patch` — incremental diff (this layout-parity run)

### Known risks / follow-ups
- At very narrow viewport widths (<900px), the 250px minimum left column may compete with the 320px minimum center column. The Saved Jobs page has the same constraint; both pages target desktop-primary widths.
- The Job Search result cards now render in a narrower column; cards with long titles or many tags will truncate more aggressively. This is the same behavior Saved Jobs has.
- Visual validation at supported desktop widths is recommended before merge.

## Run 3 — Day 74 Polish Pass: Tile Order, Noise Reduction, Alignment (March 15, 2026)

### Summary
Consistency and polish pass bringing Job Search's detail panel closer to Saved Jobs in tile order, text density, and Match Breakdown alignment while preserving Job Search's distinct search/exploration purpose.

### What changed

**JobSearchScreen.tsx:**
- **Tile reorder:** Top info tiles now follow Saved Jobs scan order: Salary → Grade & Promotion → Work Mode → Deadline. Previously was Agency → Grade → Salary → Work Mode → Deadline.
- **Agency removed from tiles:** The Agency tile was removed from the decision summary band. Agency is already shown in the fixed header zone (FIXED ZONE 1) under the job title, consistent with how Saved Jobs treats identity (title + agency) separately from decision-relevant detail tiles.
- **Grid minWidth aligned:** Tile grid changed from `minmax(140px, 1fr)` to `minmax(150px, 1fr)` to match Saved Jobs exactly.
- **Helper text removed:** Removed "Job match weights what this announcement emphasizes most." one-liner — did not pull its weight.
- **PathAdvisor helper removed:** Removed "Details appear in PathAdvisor." helper text below match breakdown — obvious from context.
- **Career Readiness CTA simplified:** "Open Career Readiness: Fix {label} (+{points})" shortened to "Fix {label}" — the full context now lives in the tooltip. More restrained, less busy.
- **Explain action shortened:** "Explain this match" → "Explain Match" for a tighter feel.
- **Match Breakdown alignment fixed:** Status column header and row values changed from `w-[48px]` to `w-[56px]` to match Saved Jobs' breakdown column widths. All five columns (Dimension 120px, Score flex, Pts 32px, Demand 48px, Status 56px) now match exactly across both screens.

**JobSearchScreen.test.tsx:**
- Updated "Day 74: decision summary band" test to check for Salary, Grade, Work Mode, Deadline (no longer checks for Agency tile).
- Updated "Day 62: Details appear in PathAdvisor" test to only check that "What you're missing" is not present (helper text removed).
- Updated "Open Career Readiness CTA" test to check for the simplified "Fix " prefix instead of "Open Career Readiness".

### Tab naming confirmation
- Tabs already said "Match Overview" and "Job Details" — no change needed. Confirmed correct.

### Files changed this run
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` (M) — tile reorder, Agency removal, noise reduction, alignment fix
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.test.tsx` (M) — test updates for changed text

### Commands run
- `npx vitest run packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.test.tsx` — 44 tests passed (exit 0)
- `npx vitest run packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.test.tsx` — 10 tests passed (exit 0)
- Linter: clean (no errors in modified files)

### Git state
- `git branch --show-current`: `feature/day-74-job-search-parity-with-saved-jobs-v1`
- `git status`: 3 files modified (merge-notes, JobSearchScreen.tsx, JobSearchScreen.test.tsx), 1 untracked (change-briefs/day-74.md)
- `git diff --name-status develop...HEAD`: empty (no commits on branch)
- `git diff --stat develop...HEAD`: empty (all changes in working tree)
- No commits made. No push.

### Patch artifacts
- `artifacts/day-74.patch` — cumulative working-tree diff (92 KB)
- `artifacts/day-74-this-run.patch` — incremental diff for this run (86 KB)

### Known risks / follow-ups
- The chevron icon on interactive Match Breakdown rows adds a small amount of extra width beyond the Status column. This is cosmetically acceptable at desktop widths and matches the existing interactive-row pattern in the screen.
- Visual validation at desktop width recommended to confirm tile rhythm, breakdown alignment, and action row density match expectations.
- Human simulation gate: not required for this run (pure UI polish, no logic changes, no persistence changes, no routing changes).

## Run 4 — Day 74 Shared Match Breakdown Table: Alignment + Interaction Parity (March 15, 2026)

### Summary
Extracted the match-breakdown dimension table into a shared component (`MatchBreakdownTable.tsx`) and integrated it into both Job Search and Saved Jobs. This eliminates the cross-page inconsistency where Job Search had interactive rows (hover, click, focus-visible, tooltip, chevron) and Saved Jobs had static divs. Both screens now use the same shared component with identical alignment, column widths, and interaction model. The alignment bug (header not accounting for row padding and chevron column) is also fixed.

### What changed

**NEW: `packages/ui/src/components/MatchBreakdownTable.tsx`**
- `MatchBreakdownRowData` interface: normalized data shape for a single dimension row, used by both screens.
- `MatchBreakdownHeader` component: shared column-header row with px-1 padding and a trailing 20px spacer matching the chevron column in data rows. Fixes the alignment bug where header labels were offset from row data.
- `MatchBreakdownRow` component: shared interactive row with `<button>`, `INTERACTIVE_HOVER_CLASS`, `focus-visible:ring-2`, hover border/background, `Tooltip`, `ChevronRight` on hover/focus, and `role="progressbar"` accessibility on the score bar. Accepts optional `onRowClick` callback.

**`packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx`**
- Added imports for `MatchBreakdownHeader`, `MatchBreakdownRow`, `MatchBreakdownRowData`.
- Replaced the inline column-header div and inline `<button>` rows in the match breakdown section with `<MatchBreakdownHeader />` and `<MatchBreakdownRow />` calls.
- Each Job Search dimension maps its `JobMatchDimension` data to `MatchBreakdownRowData` and passes `onRowClick` to open the dimension briefing.

**`packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.tsx`**
- Added imports for `MatchBreakdownHeader`, `MatchBreakdownRow`, `MatchBreakdownRowData`.
- Replaced the inline column-header div and inline static `<div>` rows with `<MatchBreakdownHeader />` and `<MatchBreakdownRow />` calls.
- Each Saved Jobs dimension maps its `MatchDimension` data to `MatchBreakdownRowData`. No `onRowClick` is passed (rows are hoverable/focusable but do not navigate — click action can be added later).
- Rows now have hover, focus-visible, tooltip, and chevron affordances that were previously absent.

### Alignment fix details
- Header row now includes `px-1` padding matching the `<button>` row padding, so all columns align.
- Header row includes a trailing `w-[20px]` spacer matching the chevron column in data rows, preventing the Status header from appearing offset left.
- All column widths remain: Dimension 120px, Score flex-1, Pts 32px, Demand 48px, Status 56px, Chevron 20px.

### Files changed this run
- `packages/ui/src/components/MatchBreakdownTable.tsx` (A) — new shared component
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` (M) — replaced inline breakdown with shared component
- `packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.tsx` (M) — replaced inline breakdown with shared component

### Commands run
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — exit 0 (clean)
- `npx vitest run packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.test.tsx packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.test.tsx` — 54 tests passed (44 + 10), exit 0
- Linter: clean (no errors in modified files)

### Git state
- `git branch --show-current`: `feature/day-74-job-search-parity-with-saved-jobs-v1`
- `git status`: 4 files modified (merge-notes, JobSearchScreen.tsx, SavedJobsScreen.tsx, JobSearchScreen.test.tsx), 2 untracked (MatchBreakdownTable.tsx, change-briefs/day-74.md)
- `git diff --name-status develop...HEAD`: empty (no commits on branch)
- `git diff --stat`: 4 files, 1434 insertions, 520 deletions
- No commits made. No push.

### Patch artifacts
- `artifacts/day-74.patch` — cumulative working-tree diff (115 KB)
- `artifacts/day-74-this-run.patch` — incremental diff for this run (115 KB)

### Known risks / follow-ups
- Saved Jobs rows do not yet fire an `onRowClick` action. The visual affordance (hover, chevron) is present, but clicking is a no-op. A follow-up could wire rows to open a PathAdvisor dimension context panel.
- The Saved Jobs breakdown now uses `<ul>/<li>` structure (matching Job Search) instead of a flat `<div>` container. The `space-y-2.5` on the outer container is retained for vertical rhythm.
- Human simulation gate: not required (UI component extraction, no logic changes, no persistence changes, no routing changes).

## Run 5 — Day 74 Match Overview Cleanup: Remove Redundant Summary Stats + Interaction Parity (March 15, 2026)

### Summary
Removed the redundant summary stat grids (Readiness, Weighted Fit/Job Match, Limiting Factor/Primary Blocker) from the Match Overview section on both Job Search and Saved Jobs. These values were already visible in the header badges (FIXED ZONE 1), making the grid redundant. Preserved useful recommendation guidance as compact advisory lines. Additionally, wired Saved Jobs breakdown row clicks to publish dimension-explanation context to PathAdvisor — matching the same interaction pattern already present in Job Search.

### What changed

**`packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx`:**
- Removed the 3-cell summary stat grid (Readiness / Job Match / Primary blocker) from the Match Intelligence section. All three values were already displayed in the header badges.
- Replaced with a compact single-line advisory `<p>` element that renders `jobMatch.primaryBlocker` — preserving the actionable guidance without restating headline metrics.
- The advisory uses subdued text (`--p-text-muted`) with a bottom border separator above the match breakdown table.

**`packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.tsx`:**
- Removed the 4-cell summary stat grid (Readiness / Weighted Fit / Limiting Factor / Top Action) from the Match Overview section. Readiness and match score were already in header badges.
- Replaced with a compact advisory line: "Top action: {matchSummary.topAction}" — preserving the actionable recommendation in a lighter, non-redundant form.
- Added `import { publishDimensionExplainContext } from '../lib/pathAdvisorPublish'`.
- Wired all breakdown row `onRowClick` callbacks to call `publishDimensionExplainContext` with the selected job and dimension context. This mirrors the same interaction pattern used in Job Search:
  - Clicking a dimension row publishes a PathAdvisor context entry with: what the dimension measures, user's current signal, and fastest fix advice.
  - Dedupe key prevents duplicate entries for the same dimension/score.
  - Anchor is the current saved job (id + title).
  - Screen is 'saved-jobs' for proper log attribution.

### Files changed this run

### Patch artifacts
- `artifacts/day-74.patch` — cumulative working-tree diff (124 KB)
- `artifacts/day-74-this-run.patch` — incremental diff for this run (124 KB)

### Known risks / follow-ups
- The Saved Jobs dimension-explain payload is lighter than Job Search's (no `buildDimensionBriefingPayload` with evidence-found/missing detail). A follow-up could introduce a Saved Jobs-specific snapshot to produce richer evidence data.
- The Saved Jobs `topAction` advisory text is prefixed with "Top action:" while Job Search renders `primaryBlocker` directly (which already includes its own "Primary blocker:" prefix). Both are intentional — they surface different but equivalent guidance.
- Human simulation gate: not required (UI simplification + interaction wiring, no logic changes to core data, no persistence changes, no routing changes).

## March 25, 2026 — Resume Builder UX Compression Pass

**Branch:** `feature/backend-usajobs-ingestion-v1`

### Summary
UX compression and decision-first refinement pass for Resume Builder. Shifted the experience from "analysis dump" to "clear next move" by:
1. Adding a **Resume Brief** compact summary strip (readiness, match, blocker, fastest win, pending count)
2. Compressing **Suggested Changes** into collapsed-by-default proposal rows with Apply/Review/Explain actions
3. Compressing **Coverage Map** into compact visual dimension cards with expand-on-demand detail
4. Reducing explanation density across the workspace — moved deeper reasoning behind PathAdvisor
5. Updating action language to be pragmatic (Fix now, Review fixes, Apply suggestion)
6. Keeping Edit tab calmer with the brief layer replacing the dense intelligence strip

### Files changed this run
- `packages/ui/src/screens/ResumeBuilderScreen.tsx` (M) — added ResumeBrief, ImpactLevel, compressed ProposalCard, compressed CoverageMapTab, reduced copy density
- `packages/ui/src/screens/ResumeBuilderScreen.test.tsx` (M) — added 14 Phase 3 tests for impact levels, score gain, compressed UX fields, dimension compact display
- `docs/change-briefs/resume-builder-ux-compression.md` (A) — non-technical change brief
- `docs/merge-notes/current.md` (M) — this entry

### Behavior changes
- Suggested Changes proposals render **collapsed by default** — only title, section, confidence, impact, score gain, and action buttons visible
- Only **one proposal expanded at a time** — expanding another collapses the previous
- Coverage Map dimensions render **compact by default** — score chip, severity badge, one-line action hint
- Only **one dimension expanded at a time** — same accordion pattern
- Resume Brief replaces the dense IntelligenceStrip with a calmer 5-signal summary
- PathAdvisor rail content is more concise; quick prompts unchanged
- Context strip text is shorter
- Inline bullet action labels updated to pragmatic phrasing

### Tests
- 45 total tests (31 existing + 14 new), all passing
- New test suites: getProposalImpactLevel, estimateScoreGain, Proposal compressed UX fields, Coverage dimension compact display, Phase 3 SSR markers
- Test command: `npx vitest run packages/ui/src/screens/ResumeBuilderScreen.test.tsx` — exit 0

### Git state
- `git branch --show-current`: `feature/backend-usajobs-ingestion-v1`
- `git status`: 2 files modified (ResumeBuilderScreen.tsx, merge-notes/current.md), 2 untracked (change brief, test file already tracked)
- `git diff --name-status develop...HEAD`: empty (no commits on branch yet)
- No commits made. No push.

### Patch artifacts
- `artifacts/resume-builder-ux-compression.patch` — cumulative working-tree diff (196.5 KB)
- `artifacts/resume-builder-ux-compression-this-run.patch` — incremental diff for this run (188.1 KB)

### Known risks / follow-ups
- The compressed ProposalCard Explain button currently opens the expanded state (same as Review). A future iteration could route to PathAdvisor with a pre-filled context prompt instead.
- Mock scores remain deterministic — real NLP engine integration is a later phase.
- Preview and Version Diff tabs still show coming-soon placeholders.
- Human simulation gate: not required (UX refinement only — no persistence changes, no routing changes, no data model changes).

## March 26, 2026 — Frontend Backend Live Advisor Integration v1

**Branch:** `feature/frontend-backend-live-advisor-integration-v1`

### Summary
- Integrated one real live advisor flow in **Saved Jobs**.
- The Saved Jobs page now loads backend-backed canonical stored jobs through frontend proxy routes and evaluates the selected stored job with the real backend advisor response.
- The integrated Saved Jobs path no longer seeds or renders mock saved-job data for evaluation.
- Added a thin adapter boundary so backend response mapping does not leak across UI components.
- Added honest loading, empty, error, and partial-evidence rendering for the live advisor panel.

### What changed
- `app/(shared)/dashboard/saved-jobs/page.tsx`
  - Switched the real Saved Jobs page to `liveAdvisor` mode.
  - Loads the persisted frontend profile from storage and sends that profile through the live stored-job evaluation path.
- `app/api/live-advisor/stored-jobs/route.ts`
  - New same-origin proxy route for backend stored-job catalog access.
- `app/api/live-advisor/stored-jobs/evaluate/route.ts`
  - New same-origin proxy route for backend stored-job evaluation access.
- `lib/live-advisor/backend.ts`
  - New backend config resolver for base URL and API key lookup.
- `lib/live-advisor/client.ts`
  - New browser-side fetch helpers for recent stored jobs and live stored-job evaluation.
- `lib/live-advisor/adapter.ts`
  - Added and kept as the single contract adapter for backend stored-job summaries, advisor output, and profile-to-request mapping.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.tsx`
  - Added live stored-job mode, honest backend-driven panel states, and live-only behavior for the integrated path.
- `packages/ui/src/screens/_components/SavedJobsLiveAdvisorPanel.tsx`
  - New presentational panel for real backend decision, reasons, gaps, warnings, missing evidence, next actions, and explainability metadata.
- `packages/ui/src/index.ts`
  - Exported the live Saved Jobs integration types and panel contract.
- Tests added:
  - `lib/live-advisor/adapter.test.ts`
  - `packages/ui/src/screens/_components/SavedJobsLiveAdvisorPanel.test.tsx`

### Primary live path
- Integrated path: **Saved Jobs selected stored-job evaluation flow**
- Live request chain:
  - frontend page -> `/api/live-advisor/stored-jobs`
  - frontend page -> `/api/live-advisor/stored-jobs/evaluate`
  - frontend proxy -> backend `/api/v1/advisor/stored-jobs`
  - frontend proxy -> backend `/api/v1/advisor/evaluate-stored-job`

### Commands run
- `pnpm test -- lib/live-advisor/adapter.test.ts packages/ui/src/screens/_components/SavedJobsLiveAdvisorPanel.test.tsx`
  - passed: 7 tests
- `pnpm typecheck`
  - passed
- `pnpm lint`
  - failed due pre-existing repo errors outside this run in `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` and `packages/ui/src/screens/ResumeBuilderScreen.tsx`
- `pnpm exec eslint "app/(shared)/dashboard/saved-jobs/page.tsx" "app/api/live-advisor/stored-jobs/route.ts" "app/api/live-advisor/stored-jobs/evaluate/route.ts" "lib/live-advisor/adapter.ts" "lib/live-advisor/client.ts" "lib/live-advisor/backend.ts" "lib/live-advisor/adapter.test.ts" "packages/ui/src/index.ts" "packages/ui/src/screens/SavedJobsScreen.tsx" "packages/ui/src/screens/_components/SavedJobsLiveAdvisorPanel.tsx" "packages/ui/src/screens/_components/SavedJobsLiveAdvisorPanel.test.tsx"`
  - passed
- `poetry run pytest -q tests/api/jobs/test__categories__advisor_stored_job.py`
  - backend tests passed but command failed on backend coverage gate
- `poetry run pytest -q --no-cov tests/api/jobs/test__categories__advisor_stored_job.py`
  - passed: 5 tests
- `pnpm test`
  - passed: 60 files, 973 tests
- `pnpm build`
  - passed
- `$env:DAY='26'; pnpm ci:validate`
  - passed, with day-label warnings from existing historical references in `merge-notes.md` and `docs/ai/generated-docs-policy.md`

### Results
- Saved Jobs now uses the real backend advisor/evaluation path for the integrated live flow.
- The integrated Saved Jobs path no longer depends on seeded mock saved jobs.
- Adapter and presentational panel coverage were added for the live contract.
- Backend spot-check for the new stored-job list endpoint passed once coverage enforcement was disabled for the targeted slice.

### Known issues
- `pnpm lint` still fails at repo level because of pre-existing errors outside this integration slice:
  - `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx`
  - `packages/ui/src/screens/ResumeBuilderScreen.tsx`
- `git rev-parse --verify develop` failed with:
  - `fatal: Needed a single revision`
- `git diff develop...HEAD` and `git diff --stat develop...HEAD` failed with:
  - `fatal: ambiguous argument 'develop...HEAD': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.`
- There were unrelated local frontend edits already present in Resume Builder files and untracked resume-builder change briefs. The repo-wide incremental diff artifact therefore includes unrelated existing worktree changes in addition to this integration run.
- Job Search still remains mocked in this phase. Only the Saved Jobs path is live.

## Live integration v1 completion assessment
- Completed:
  - one real live path in Saved Jobs now uses the backend advisor/evaluation contract
  - the integrated Saved Jobs path bypasses mock saved-job evaluation data
  - loading, empty, error, and partial-evidence states are explicit and honest
  - backend contract translation is isolated in one adapter layer
- Still mocked or deferred:
  - Job Search remains outside the live backend path
  - Dashboard and Career Readiness only retain existing behavior and did not receive broad live integration
- Readiness:
  - the system is ready for the next live integration slice

### Concise summary
- Files changed:
  - Saved Jobs page wrapper, live advisor proxy routes, live advisor adapter/client/config helpers, Saved Jobs live panel, UI exports, required change briefs, merge notes
- Tests run:
  - targeted adapter/panel tests
  - full frontend test suite

# 2026-03-26 — Job Search live advisor integration v1

## Summary of changes

- Wired the Job Search selected-job evaluation path to the real backend advisor flow through the frontend proxy route at `app/api/live-advisor/evaluate/route.ts`.
- Reused and extended the live advisor adapter/client boundary in `lib/live-advisor/adapter.ts` and `lib/live-advisor/client.ts` so backend mapping remains isolated from the UI.
- Updated `app/(shared)/dashboard/job-search/page.tsx` and `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` so the selected job requests live evaluation, ignores stale responses, and renders honest loading, empty, error, warning, missing-evidence, and explainability states.
- Preserved the Saved Jobs live path and kept this phase scoped to the Job Search selected-job flow.

## Commands run

- `$env:DAY='26'; pnpm ci:validate`
  - passed, with existing historical day-label warnings

## Results

- Job Search selected-job evaluation now uses the live backend advisor contract.
- Mock advisor output is bypassed for the integrated Job Search selected-job path.
- Saved Jobs remained live-wired and was not regressed by the shared adapter/client changes.
- The selected-job panel now guards against stale responses when users change jobs quickly.
- The integrated flow now surfaces backend reasons, gaps, warnings, missing evidence, next actions, confidence, and explainability metadata directly.

## Known issues

- `pnpm lint` still fails at repo level because of a pre-existing `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` error in `packages/ui/src/screens/ResumeBuilderScreen.tsx:4679`.
- The frontend repo still does not have a usable local `develop` ref, so `git diff develop...HEAD` and `git diff --stat develop...HEAD` cannot be used as a baseline here.
- There are unrelated local frontend edits already present in Saved Jobs and Resume Builder files, plus existing untracked files under `app/api/live-advisor/`, `lib/live-advisor/`, and several change briefs. The repo-wide incremental patch artifact therefore includes unrelated worktree changes in addition to this phase.
- The Job Search results list and search dataset remain local/mock in this slice. Only the selected-job evaluation flow is live.

# 2026-03-26 — Job Search live results v1

## Summary of changes

- Added a frontend proxy route at `app/api/live-advisor/search/route.ts` so Job Search can request backend-backed USAJOBS results without the browser calling USAJOBS directly.
- Extended the live-advisor adapter/client boundary in `lib/live-advisor/adapter.ts` and `lib/live-advisor/client.ts` to build backend search requests and normalize canonical backend jobs into the existing frontend `Job` shape.
- Updated `app/(shared)/dashboard/job-search/page.tsx` and `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx` so the main Search button, Enter key submission, prompt-apply flow, filter-guide apply actions, and Load more behavior all use the live backend search path.
- Added honest loading, empty, error, duplicate-request, stale-selection, and unsupported-filter notes for the live Job Search results flow while preserving the existing selected-job live evaluation path.
- Updated `packages/ui/src/stores/jobSearchV1Store.ts` so the store can accept live search pages, preserve or replace selection deterministically, and surface honest transient live-search errors.

## Commands run

- `git status --short`
- `git branch --show-current`

  - failed due a pre-existing repo error outside this slice in `packages/ui/src/screens/ResumeBuilderScreen.tsx:4679`
- `$env:DAY='26'; pnpm ci:validate`
  - passed, with existing historical day-label warnings

## Results

- The Job Search Search button now uses live backend-backed data.
- The main Job Search result list no longer relies on local/mock seeding for the live path.
- Selected-job live evaluation still works on top of real backend-backed search results.
- Load more now requests the next backend page instead of paging through a mock in-memory search result set.
- The build confirmed the new route `/api/live-advisor/search` is registered in the app.

## Known issues

- `pnpm lint` still fails at repo level because of a pre-existing `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` error in `packages/ui/src/screens/ResumeBuilderScreen.tsx:4679`.
- The frontend repo still does not have a usable local `develop` ref, so `git diff develop...HEAD` and `git diff --stat develop...HEAD` cannot be used as a baseline here.
- There are unrelated local frontend edits already present in Saved Jobs and Resume Builder files, plus existing untracked files under `app/api/live-advisor/`, `lib/live-advisor/`, and several change briefs. The repo-wide incremental patch artifact therefore includes unrelated worktree changes in addition to this phase.
- The Job Search agency filter still stores display names while the backend search contract expects official USAJOBS organization codes, so the live path surfaces that limitation honestly instead of faking agency-code mapping.
- Some auxiliary Job Search guide datasets and document-style detail content remain local deterministic frontend content.

- Selected-job live evaluation:
  - yes, the existing selected-job live advisor evaluation still works on top of the live search results path
- Saved Jobs stability:
  - Saved Jobs remained stable and live-wired in this phase
- Still mocked:
  - the Job Search agency filter is not fully live-mapped because the frontend still stores agency display names instead of official organization codes
  - some auxiliary Job Search guide datasets and local detail-copy helpers remain deterministic frontend content
- Readiness:

- Added a committed frontend env template at `.env.local.example` for local live Job Search and Saved Jobs integration.
- Tightened the shared live-advisor backend config helper in `lib/live-advisor/backend.ts` so required env behavior is explicit and the missing-config error is clearer.
- Added direct config helper coverage in `lib/live-advisor/backend.test.ts`.
- Updated `README.md` and `docs/change-briefs/job-search-live-results-v1.md` so local frontend/backend setup, backend key alignment, restart behavior, and verification steps are explicit.

## Results

- The frontend repo now contains a safe local env template for live backend integration.
- The live advisor/search proxy routes still use one shared config helper instead of scattered env reads.
- Missing backend auth config now returns a clearer setup error that points the operator to `.env.local.example` and the frontend restart requirement.
- Local setup is now documented in the repo root README instead of being implied only by code and prior merge notes.

## Known issues

- This repo still does not have a usable local `develop` ref, so `git diff develop...HEAD` and `git diff --stat develop...HEAD` still fail exactly as logged below.
- The repo-wide working tree still contains unrelated local edits and untracked files from parallel work, so the incremental patch artifact includes more than this narrow config follow-up.
- `pnpm exec eslint lib/live-advisor/backend.ts lib/live-advisor/backend.test.ts README.md` produced a README ignore warning because the repo does not supply markdown eslint config. The changed TypeScript files lint cleanly.
- Practical local runtime verification still depends on the developer filling `.env.local` with a real backend URL and accepted API key, then running frontend and backend together.

## Patch artifacts

- Required custom artifacts:

- Day validation artifacts refreshed:
  - `artifacts/day-26.patch`
  - `artifacts/day-26-run.patch`
- `artifacts/job-search-live-results-v1.patch`
  - contains the exact `develop...HEAD` baseline failure text because no local `develop` ref is available
- `artifacts/job-search-live-results-v1-this-run.patch`
  - contains the current working-tree diff excluding `artifacts/`
- `ls -lh` outputs:
  - `job-search-live-results-v1.patch` - `200 B`
  - `job-search-live-results-v1-this-run.patch` - `339,401 B`
  - `day-26.patch` - `200 B`
  - `day-26-run.patch` - `339,401 B`

## Frontend live config follow-up assessment

- Frontend config files created or updated:
  - created `.env.local.example`
  - updated `lib/live-advisor/backend.ts`
  - updated `README.md`
  - updated `docs/change-briefs/job-search-live-results-v1.md`
- Required env vars for local live integration:
  - `PATHOS_BACKEND_BASE_URL`
  - `PATHOS_BACKEND_API_KEY`
  - `PATHOS_API_KEYS` remains a supported fallback, but local frontend setup should prefer `PATHOS_BACKEND_API_KEY`
- Live-path readiness once env is filled in:
  - Job Search and Saved Jobs live paths are ready once `.env.local` points at the running backend and uses an API key accepted by backend `PATHOS_API_KEYS`
- Remaining known limitation:
  - runtime success still depends on the operator providing a real local backend URL and accepted key; this follow-up only makes that setup explicit and test-covered

# Job Search live results v1 - final closeout safety review

## Summary of changes

- Performed a release-style closeout inspection of the current frontend branch for sensitive data exposure, unsafe config, and branch coherence.
- Found and corrected one real safety issue: `.env.local.example` contained a concrete backend API key value instead of a placeholder.
- Re-validated the live Job Search results flow, selected-job live evaluation flow, and Saved Jobs live path after the placeholder correction.

## Results

- No sensitive data remains in the tracked example env file after the fix.
- The live-advisor proxy routes and helper files do not contain embedded keys, payload dumps, or unsafe logging.
- No tracked local `.env.local` file is present; only `.env.local.example` is visible in the repo, and it is now placeholder-only.
- The branch remains coherent for the current ticket scope: live Job Search results use backend-backed data, selected-job live evaluation still works, and Saved Jobs remains live-wired.

## Known issues

- This repo still does not have a usable local `develop` ref, so `git diff develop...HEAD` and `git diff --stat develop...HEAD` still fail exactly as logged below.
- The working tree still contains unrelated local edits and untracked files from parallel work, so the incremental patch artifact includes more than this ticket alone.
- `pnpm build` still emits the existing `baseline-browser-mapping` staleness warnings, but the build passes.
- The Job Search agency filter still uses frontend display names while the backend contract expects official USAJOBS organization codes; that limitation remains documented honestly.

  - `job-search-live-results-v1.patch` - `200 B`
  - `job-search-live-results-v1-this-run.patch` - `346,796 B`

## Final closeout safety assessment

- Sensitive data risk found:
  - yes, one concrete backend API key had been left in `.env.local.example`
- Unsafe config removed or corrected:
  - yes, that concrete key was replaced with the placeholder `replace-with-your-local-backend-api-key`
- Example config files safe:
  - yes, the tracked example env file is now placeholder-only
- Branch ready for commit/PR:
  - yes for the scoped ticket, with the honest limitation that unrelated parallel work is still present in the wider working tree
- Remaining honest limitation:
  - the Job Search agency filter still is not fully code-mapped to backend organization codes, and the repo still lacks a usable local `develop` ref for baseline diff commands

## Day 10 — Job Search Contract Hardening v1 (2026-03-26)

## Summary

- Hardened Job Search salary rendering so the selected-job summary band prefers structured live compensation data and uses an explicit fallback when structured salary is missing.
- Corrected live filter contract mapping in the frontend adapter for curated agency filters and real USAJOBS appointment-type codes.
- Replaced the tiny location dropdown in the filter bar with free-text location input that stays aligned with the one backend location field.
- Removed invented promotion-ladder copy from the selected-job panel when promotion potential is not actually structured in the result.

## Files changed

- `lib/live-advisor/adapter.ts`
- `lib/live-advisor/adapter.test.ts`
- `packages/core/src/job-types.ts`
- `packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.tsx`

- `docs/change-briefs/job-search-contract-hardening-v1.md`
- `docs/change-briefs/day-10.md`
- `docs/merge-notes/current.md`

## Job Search contract hardening assessment

- Salary rendering is now materially better: live results with structured pay data render formatted salary ranges in the main salary tile, and missing salary now falls back to explicit trust-first copy instead of `See announcement`.
- Filters now correctly live-map for:
  - agency values in the curated frontend list through official USAJOBS agency subelement codes
  - grade filters through `grade_min` and `grade_max`
  - series filters through USAJOBS series arrays
  - appointment type filters through real USAJOBS `PositionOfferingTypeCode` values
  - location filtering through one shared free-text location field
- Remaining limits or deferrals:
  - agency live mapping is bounded to the curated agency set exposed in this screen
  - telework and hybrid semantics still do not have a fuller live filter beyond `Remote`
  - pay-plan context is only shown when the result actually carries it
- Job Search is now substantially more usable with live data because salary, location, and filter behavior are more honest and materially closer to the backend contract.

## Commands run

  - failed exactly with: `fatal: a branch named 'feature/job-search-contract-hardening-v1' already exists`

- `pnpm docs:day-patches --day 10`
  - pass
- `$env:DAY='10'; pnpm ci:validate`
  - pass with existing day-label warnings from historical docs

## Results

- Live search results now carry structured salary min and max values into the frontend job model, and the selected-job salary tile formats those values with real currency separators.
- Appointment type labels now match actual USAJOBS appointment semantics instead of the incorrect `Competitive` and `Excepted` labels that were previously being sent to the backend.
- The filter-bar location control is now free-text and synchronized with the live search request field, which removes the previous hard-coded location bottleneck.
- Selected-job live evaluation, live Search button behavior, live results loading, and Saved Jobs live paths were preserved through the hardening pass.

## Known issues

- The named cumulative patch artifact required by this run is empty because the exact requested command `git diff develop...HEAD` reports no committed delta on this branch; the actual uncommitted work appears in the incremental patch artifact.
- Agency live mapping is intentionally limited to the curated agencies exposed in the current screen; unsupported agency names still need additional code-list coverage if the UI broadens later.
- Telework and hybrid filtering remain more limited than remote-only filtering in the live backend contract.
- `pnpm build` still emits the existing `baseline-browser-mapping` age warnings, but the build completed successfully.

## Day 10 — Job Search Contract Hardening v1 Follow-up (2026-03-26)

## Summary

- Hardened Job Search truth and usability around live results without broadening scope beyond the frontend surface.
- Reset now restores a sensible live default search instead of leaving the user on a blank post-reset state.
- Multi-location rendering is now query-aware, so searched locations are surfaced first and long lists collapse cleanly.
- The Grade & Promotion card remains in place, but missing promotion data now uses compact fallback copy instead of filler text.
- The selected-job USAJOBS button now resolves from the active job with a safer fallback path for numeric USAJOBS ids.

## Job Search contract hardening assessment

- Salary rendering remains materially better from the earlier pass and is still using structured live pay data when it exists.
- Filters now correctly live-map for grade, series, curated agency values, appointment type, and the shared free-text location field.
- Remaining limits or deferrals:
  - agency mapping is still intentionally bounded to the curated agencies surfaced in this screen
  - telework and hybrid semantics are still more limited than remote-only filtering in the live backend contract
  - sort remains a frontend ordering control rather than a backend sort contract
- Job Search is now substantially more usable with live data because reset, location reading, and selected-job announcement fidelity are less misleading.

## Commands run

- `pnpm vitest run packages/ui/src/screens/JobSearchScreen.test.tsx lib/live-advisor/adapter.test.ts packages/ui/src/stores/jobSearchV1Store.test.ts`
  - pass after one assertion update for the compacted multi-location detail rendering

  - pass with existing `baseline-browser-mapping` staleness warnings
- `pnpm ci:validate`
  - failed exactly with: `ERROR: DAY environment variable is required`
- `$env:DAY='10'; pnpm ci:validate`
  - pass with existing historical day-label warnings
- `git status --short`
- `git branch --show-current`
- `git diff --name-status develop...HEAD`
  - produced no output
- `git diff --stat develop...HEAD`
  - produced no output
- `git diff develop...HEAD > artifacts/job-search-contract-hardening-v1.patch`
  - wrote an empty cumulative patch because the requested diff produced no output
- `git diff > artifacts/job-search-contract-hardening-v1-this-run.patch`
  - pass
- `bash -lc "ls -lh artifacts/job-search-contract-hardening-v1.patch artifacts/job-search-contract-hardening-v1-this-run.patch"`
  - pass

## Results

- Reset now clears filters and inputs, restores a broad live keyword, and re-runs live search instead of leaving the workspace empty.
- Multi-location jobs now move matched searched locations to the front, highlight them, and collapse the remaining locations behind a compact count.
- The selected-job location line and the USAJOBS action both now stay anchored to the current selected job contract instead of relying on a generic fallback.
- The Grade & Promotion card still shows grade when available, only shows promotion potential when structured data exists, and no longer uses the previous filler sentence.

## Known issues

- The exact required command `pnpm ci:validate` still fails in this repo unless `DAY` is provided in the environment; the compatibility run with `DAY=10` passes.
- `git diff develop...HEAD` and `git diff --stat develop...HEAD` both produced no output on this branch, so the cumulative named patch remains empty.
- `pnpm build` still emits the existing `baseline-browser-mapping` age warnings, but the build completed successfully.
